This paper introduces WARP (Web-Augmented Real-time Program Repairer), a novel system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and dynamic web-augmented synthesis for real-time resolution of these errors.

Experimental results on our curated benchmark, CGP (featuring C/C++, Python, and Go errors), demonstrate WARP achieves a superior fix rate (72.5 % Compiles correctly) and higher semantic correctness compared to baseline LLM-only approaches and traditional IDE quick-fixes.

Harnessing their broad cross-domain knowledge, text-processing, and reasoning abilities for software development, e.g., numerical libraries for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), is therefore attracting growing interest. Yet existing studies mainly automate case setup and execution for end users. We introduce LLM-PDEveloper, a zero-shot, multi-agent LLM framework that automates code development for PDE libraries, specifically targeting secondary developers. By translating mathematical and algorithmic descriptions directly into source code, LLM-PDEveloper generates new solvers/modules and adapts existing ones. This end-to-end math-to-code approach enables a self-augmenting pipeline that continuously expands the codebase of a library, extends its capacities, and broadens its scope. We demonstrate LLM-PDEveloper on three tasks: 1) build a solver for a new PDE, 2) implement new BCs for a given PDE, and 3) modify an existing solver to incorporate additional terms, achieving moderate success rates. Failures due to syntactic errors made by LLMs are analyzed and we propose effective fixes. We also identify the mechanisms underlying certain semantic errors, guiding future research.",

Evaluated on 81 real-world APIs from widely used scientific Python libraries and benchmarked against instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs guided by expert prompts, APRIL achieves substantial improvements.

SLS maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual consistency.

To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting (STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns. Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble forecasting.

Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies, LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons, similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders). This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework, providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.",

Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set, yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that, unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.",

By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term functional regeneration.

Due to the sparsity of time series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain, it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.

We propose \\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+ recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution, retaining 95.2\\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs.

        "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast, Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance for choosing between reasoning paradigms.

However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics, commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER stimulates model \"curiosity\" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.",

While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal. This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs, enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\\&A) tasks while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\\&A dataset. Our results demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the foundational model in cybersecurity Q\\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains. Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.",

To address this gap, we introduce MULocBench, a comprehensive dataset of 1,100 issues from 46 popular GitHub Python projects. Comparing with existing benchmarks, MULocBench offers greater diversity in issue types, root causes, location scopes, and file types, providing a more realistic testbed for evaluation. Using this benchmark, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art localization methods and five LLM-based prompting strategies. Our results reveal significant limitations in current techniques: even at the file level, performance metrics (Acc@5, F1) remain below 40%. This underscores the challenge of generalizing to realistic, multi-faceted issue resolution.

Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs 1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement. Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks), superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions. Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight. Implications: Cost reduction from \\$50,000 to \\$500 democratizes qualitative research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes qualitative insights contemporaneous with events.

In recent times, the use of LLMs for code generation has gained significant attention, with tools such as Cursor and Windsurf demonstrating the ability to analyze massive code repositories and recommend relevant changes. Big tech companies have also acknowledged the growing reliance on LLMs for code generation within their codebases. Although these advances significantly improve developer productivity, increasing reliance on automated code generation can proportionally increase the risk of suboptimal solutions and insecure code. Our work focuses on automatically sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations which can improve model performance and enhance the interpretability of the generated code. Using AST-based analysis on outputs from the MBPP test set, we identify regions of code most influenced by the chosen demonstrations. In our experiments, we show that high-quality ICL demonstrations not only make outputs easier to interpret but also yield a positive performance improvement on the pass@10 metric. Conversely, poorly chosen ICL demonstrations affected the LLM performance on the pass@10 metric negatively compared to the base model. Overall, our approach highlights the importance of efficient sampling strategies for ICL, which can affect the performance of the model on any given task.",

Existing methods rely on manually curated rules and workflows, which cannot adapt to OSS that requires customized configuration or environment setup. Recent attempts using Large Language Models (LLMs) used selective evaluation on a subset of highly rated OSS, a practice that underestimates the realistic challenges of OSS compilation. In practice, compilation instructions are often absent, dependencies are undocumented, and successful builds may even require patching source files or modifying build scripts. We propose a more challenging and realistic benchmark, BUILD-BENCH, comprising OSS that are more diverse in quality, scale, and characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a strong baseline LLM-based agent, OSS-BUILD-AGENT, an effective system with enhanced build instruction retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art performance on BUILD-BENCH and is adaptable to heterogeneous OSS characteristics. We also provide detailed analysis regarding different compilation method design choices and their influence to the whole task, offering insights to guide future advances. We believe performance on BUILD-BENCH can faithfully reflect an agent's ability to tackle compilation as a complex software engineering tasks, and, as such, our benchmark will spur innovation with a significant impact on downstream applications in the fields of software development and software security.",

This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance.

We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2 to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.",

While traditional distillation methods leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.",

Planning involves structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior. Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar, path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.",

Existing evaluations primarily focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation, leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions, and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns. Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban studies, and spatial analysis.",

The PPN, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function, learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5% token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive accuracy.

In this study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-QuÃ©bec asset observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE) by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%. Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems, which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.",

This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.",

In this work, we introduce VoiceBridge, a GSR system rooted in latent bridge models (LBMs), capable of reconstructing high-fidelity speech at full-band (\\textit{i.e.,} 48~kHz) from various distortions. By compressing speech waveform into continuous latent representations, VoiceBridge models the~\\textit{diverse LQ-to-HQ tasks} (namely, low-quality to high-quality) in GSR with~\\textit{a single latent-to-latent generative process} backed by a scalable transformer architecture. To better inherit the advantages of bridge models from the data domain to the latent space, we present an energy-preserving variational autoencoder, enhancing the alignment between the waveform and latent space over varying energy levels. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of HQ reconstruction from distinctively different LQ priors, we propose a joint neural prior, uniformly alleviating the reconstruction burden of LBM. At last, considering the key requirement of GSR systems, human perceptual quality, a perceptually aware fine-tuning stage is designed to mitigate the cascading mismatch in generation while improving perceptual alignment. Extensive validation across in-domain and out-of-domain tasks and datasets (\\textit{e.g.}, refining recent zero-shot speech and podcast generation results) demonstrates the superior performance of VoiceBridge.

In this work, we introduce MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large (making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4% and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches, respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement. Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.",

However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple \"world model\" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.",

Results revealed broad similarity between real and simulated datasets, particularly in regional variation trends. However, systematic differences emerged:simulated participants scored lower in extraversion and openness, higher in agreeableness and neuroticism, and consistently reported lower happiness. Predictive structures also diverged: while human data identified conscientiousness, extraversion and openness as positive predictors of happiness, the AI emphasized openness and agreeableness, with extraversion predicting negatively. These discrepancies suggest that while LLMs can approximate population-level psychological distributions, they underrepresent culturally specific and affective dimensions. The findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based virtual participants for large-scale psychological research and underscore the need for culturally enriched training data and improved affective modeling.",

However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures, including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic, structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned generative agents.

This paper presents a systematic empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale, data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget, larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.",

In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks (e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We further introduce Overuse Rate ($\\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count ($\\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\\% of LLM agents display a pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall Risk Score ($\\Phi_\\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical deployment of LLM agents.",

Through analysis, we identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{LUMA} (\\textit{\\textbf{L}ow-dimension \\textbf{U}nified \\textbf{M}otion \\textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates convergence by 1.4$\\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.",

We present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA) benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple, knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes. Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better models.\nBenchmark: http://paulgavrikov.github.io/visualoverload",

However, the presence of vital signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First, we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator. Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos with desired vital signs.",

Over the years, powerful tools like the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) have been developed, offering numerous motion planning algorithms. However, existing frameworks often struggle to deliver the level of predictability and repeatability demanded by high-stakes applications -- ranging from ensuring safety in industrial environments to the creation of high-quality motion datasets for robot learning. Complementing existing tools, we introduce SRMP (Search-based Robot Motion Planning), a new software framework tailored for robotic manipulation. SRMP distinguishes itself by generating consistent and reliable trajectories, and is the first software tool to offer motion planning algorithms for multi-robot manipulation tasks. SRMP easily integrates with major simulators, including MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, and PyBullet via a Python and C++ API. SRMP includes a dedicated MoveIt! plugin that enables immediate deployment on robot hardware and seamless integration with existing pipelines. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate in this paper that SRMP not only meets the rigorous demands of industrial and safety-critical applications but also sets a new standard for consistency in motion planning across diverse robotic systems.

Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware, video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts. Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\\% success on folding T-shirts from the flattened state and 67\\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\\% and 0\\% success. Overall, our results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable, annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon manipulation.",

In response to the scarcity of value conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written \"user prompt\" and evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values, such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a foundation for future work in this area.",

Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way, and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action, and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA, and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24% higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AgentDebug",

This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition.\" We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.",

Our categories target translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37 state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\\%), task difficulty as measured by human response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs. We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space.

While standard architectures like ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT), a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.",

We address this gap through an exploratory analysis of open collaboration throughout the development and reuse lifecycle of open LLMs, drawing on semi-structured interviews with the developers of 14 open LLMs from grassroots projects, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. We make three key contributions to research and practice. First, collaboration in open LLM projects extends far beyond the LLMs themselves, encompassing datasets, benchmarks, open source frameworks, leaderboards, knowledge sharing and discussion forums, and compute partnerships, among others. Second, open LLM developers have a variety of social, economic, and technological motivations, from democratizing AI access and promoting open science to building regional ecosystems and expanding language representation. Third, the sampled open LLM projects exhibit five distinct organizational models, ranging from single company projects to non-profit-sponsored grassroots projects, which vary in their centralization of control and community engagement strategies used throughout the open LLM lifecycle. We conclude with practical recommendations for stakeholders seeking to support the global community building a more open future for AI.",

To alleviate this bottleneck, many sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves 2.5$\\times$-3.8$\\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\\times$ end-to-end acceleration without degrading visual quality.",

However, when applied to more complex tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities. Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both answer correctness and usefulness.",

Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions. Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration, yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches.

Although successful in semantic understanding, state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from 2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change? We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over 2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models. Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code and model will be released at the link below.",

We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \\textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in multi-task fine-tuning, and \\textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings, through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches.

This results in inefficient exploration of reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the reasoning process.

These pretrained policies, trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising but unrefined behaviors.

This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective. Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2) modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations. Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.",

Choosing the right reasoning model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR (Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable, and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item response model from model responses with different budgets to different queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.",

This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3 bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at https://github.com/superstarghy/Norm-Q.",

This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline (CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based structure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning framework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is proposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based controller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is combined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is guided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space compliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through compliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold, ensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed strategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external disturbances under different compliance settings.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences, we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees. We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.",

        "abstract": "Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration, DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration, which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3) adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves 62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged computation.",

They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence. However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However, existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level generation.",

In this paper, we introduced BloomAPR, a novel dynamic evaluation framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. Our framework offers a structured approach to assess the cognitive capabilities of LLM-powered APR solutions across progressively complex reasoning levels. Using Defects4J as a case study, we evaluated two state-of-the-art LLM-powered APR solutions, ChatRepair and CigaR, under three different LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-3.1, and StarCoder-2. Our findings show that while these solutions exhibit basic reasoning skills and effectively memorize bug-fixing patterns (fixing up to 81.57% of bugs at the Remember layer), their performance increases with synthetically generated bugs (up to 60.66% increase at the Understand layer). However, they perform worse on minor syntactic changes (fixing up to 43.32% at the Apply layer), and they struggle to repair similar bugs when injected into real-world projects (solving only 13.46% to 41.34% bugs at the Analyze layer). These results underscore the urgent need for evolving benchmarks and provide a foundation for more trustworthy evaluation of LLM-powered software engineering solutions.",

Our approach significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real robot without using real data.",

Yet, some use cases, like image captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular interpretability frameworks.

It focuses on handling complex composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as $\\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a $\\times$2 speed-up over $\\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU.

To bridge this gap, we introduce P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations. Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.",

We extracted 2,037 empirical findings, revealing research topic clusters, common themes, and disconnected areas. Expert evaluation with 20 researchers revealed the system's effectiveness for discovering research gaps. This work demonstrates how AI can transform literature synthesis itself, offering a scalable framework for evidence-based design, opening new possibilities for computational meta-science across HCI and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge, common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals, leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse, heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.",

While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated, closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a 20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90 nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations, demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and threshold voltages.",

The findings revealed behavioral signals of digital divide: only 19.1% of users employed prompting strategies, and these users were disproportionately more educated and Democrat-leaning.

We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2 exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success rate and execution speed.

These models are often trained using flow matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points $(\\mathbf{x}_0,\\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned, on average, with $\\mathbf{x}_1-\\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment linking $\\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT) solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly, which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle. Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring $O(n^2/\\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity field, where $\\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency on $n/\\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.",

While relevant research has been conducted on single-modal language models to some extent, the vulnerabilities in the multimodal setting have yet to be fully investigated. In this work, we investigate these emerging risks with a focus on vision language models (VLMs), a representative subclass of MLLMs that covers the two modalities most relevant for PII leakage, vision and text. We introduce a concept-guided mitigation approach that identifies and modifies the model's internal states associated with PII-related content. Our method guides VLMs to refuse PII-sensitive tasks effectively and efficiently, without requiring re-training or fine-tuning. We also address the current lack of multimodal PII datasets by constructing various ones that simulate real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the method can achieve an average refusal rate of 93.3% for various PII-related tasks with minimal impact on unrelated model performances. We further examine the mitigation's performance under various conditions to show the adaptability of our proposed method.",

LLM-RG processes an image and a free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential grounding.",

The proposed system evaluates student-submitted geometric constructions by analyzing their procedural accuracy and conceptual understanding. It employs a prompt-based grading mechanism using GPT-4, where student answers and model solutions are compared through a few-shot learning approach. Feedback is generated based on teacher-authored examples built from anticipated student responses, and it dynamically adapts to the student's problem-solving history, allowing up to four iterative attempts per question. The system was piloted with 79 middle-school students, where LLM-generated grades and feedback were benchmarked against teacher judgments. Grading closely aligned with teachers, and feedback helped many students revise errors and complete multi-step geometry tasks. While short-term corrections were frequent, longer-term transfer effects were less clear. Overall, the study highlights the potential of LLMs to support scalable, teacher-aligned formative assessment in mathematics, while pointing to improvements needed in terminology handling and feedback design.",

Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities, is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval, which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood. We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG, analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.",

While LLMs can express their confidence in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about; we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims, allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.",

Existing behavioral control methods face significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end, we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection (VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone. We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.",

Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines. Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard. Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances performance for less capable models.",

        "abstract": "In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying a single \"best\" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model (LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off between cost and quality.",

Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image, and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.",

Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1) Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in \"Who Is the Spy\"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets: CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering, and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based methods.

To address this, we introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a \"pivot\" model to generate reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference, effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions, including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically, our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively, demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly multilingual reasoning agents.",

Building effective representation for team coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.",

We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.",

Housed within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas.

Contrary to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward.

For example, the input could be all the history experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates. In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes. In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function. We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e., budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more conservatively.",

In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model degradation.",

In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management, iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search.

Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback, which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without \"golden\" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and generalization.

Many prior works have approached this problem via either handcrafted constraints or paired motion datasets, limiting their applicability to humanoid characters or narrow behaviors such as locomotion. Moreover, they often assume a fixed notion of retargeting, overlooking domain-specific objectives like style preservation in animation or task-space alignment in robotics. In this work, we propose MoReFlow, Motion Retargeting via Flow Matching, an unsupervised framework that learns correspondences between characters' motion embedding spaces. Our method consists of two stages. First, we train tokenized motion embeddings for each character using a VQ-VAE, yielding compact latent representations. Then, we employ flow matching with conditional coupling to align the latent spaces across characters, which simultaneously learns conditioned and unconditioned matching to achieve robust but flexible retargeting. Once trained, MoReFlow enables flexible and reversible retargeting without requiring paired data. Experiments demonstrate that MoReFlow produces high-quality motions across diverse characters and tasks, offering improved controllability, generalization, and motion realism compared to the baselines.",

It has progressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments as reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \\cite{rahmani2025judging}. However, existing methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting strategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To fill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \\textit{Task-aware Rubric-based Evaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for usefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in relevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible workflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to evaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent, coverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE on the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE achieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary focus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based relevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across multiple dimensions.",

When it comes to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions, preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to $1024\\times1024$ resolution.",

Common practice for autoregressive language models typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning without reliance on external reward models.",

EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s. We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled threshold \\b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments suggest that the default \\b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model pruning while \\b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to meet specific sparsity requirements.",

In previous work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity, proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work, we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand, these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part of their FrÃ©chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type, for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with a Vlasov flow.",

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank, a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40% compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.",

This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses.",

Given its importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance. However, with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task. Although manual optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone. In this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and optimize Gaussian splatting kernels. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels. We reveal the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code optimization techniques from the LLMs. We also propose ways to collaborate with LLMs to further leverage their capabilities. For the original 3DGS code on the MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and 24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs. By feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on average. In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. On the other hand, even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations, Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts.

To address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation. Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP) using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.",

In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes, Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL). Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research, to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of more functional multi-agent systems.",

To address these challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.

        "abstract": "Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior navigation performance.",

Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel settings.

QFrBLiMP consists of 1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from an official online resource maintained by a QuÃ©bec government institution. Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category. We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these specific tasks.",

        "abstract": "Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are \"unsolvable\" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer. Consequently, the model's \"upper limit\" remains unchanged after RL training, even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase. These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples, we propose NuRL, a \"nudging\" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated, avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model. Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has converged.",

To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model adapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model via a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only transfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the Mandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a model from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance intelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0 contour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units, which contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is then elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching postnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Providing timely and personalized guidance for students' programming assignments, offers significant practical value for helping students complete assignments and enhance their learning. In recent years, various automated Fault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in identifying errors in programs. However, existing FL techniques face challenges when applied to educational contexts. Most approaches operate at the method level without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for students who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While some approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on predicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained, explainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via LLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual information specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying faulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the LLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both localization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we introduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from multiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art fault localization baselines on programming assignments, successfully localizing 207 more faults at top-1 over the best-performing baseline. Beyond educational contexts, FLAME also generalizes effectively to general-purpose software codebases, outperforming all baselines on the Defects4J benchmark.",

This limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and improved interpretability.",

Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover, our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks.

Unlike standard diffusion-based planners that use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of task-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived from Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states or their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to produce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior expressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from trajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned structured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the full trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies indicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits beyond simply conditioning the neural network. Overall, our method concentrates probability mass of prior near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful trajectories while maintaining tractability.

Pruning or quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3 from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.",

Alternatively, with recent advancements in large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner.

Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However, existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further amplified. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{AIMCoT}, an \\textbf{A}ctive \\textbf{I}nformation-driven \\textbf{M}ulti-modal \\textbf{C}hain-\\textbf{o}f-\\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1) \\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention maps as a foundation. (2) \\textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions maximally. (3) \\textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process, AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and human-like multimodal reasoning.

While recent advancements in human motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements. During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy, smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects",

Although prior work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space dynamics to address the question: \"How do diffusion models memorize?\" We show that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i) memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together, these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism of memorization in diffusion models.",

However, training-free methods rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines, with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even exceeding supervised Mixture Training.

However, when applied to long-tailed distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels. By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k > 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.",

To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in preference-based learning.",

However, we argue that current large-scale reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1) field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra, geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit, and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of \"atomic thinking\".",

This symmetric conditioning leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region. Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38 safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence models to safe RL.

Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes, inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo, a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained, identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency.

While recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout. Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.",

        "abstract": "Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor, enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of 3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits, particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3) resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors, GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision, structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .",

Machine unlearning is introduced to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data. However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore, we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests, effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.",

We present a decoupled framework that learns each component where it is most reliable: control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state to master spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted only at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy. Our key insight is that control strategies and action patterns are universal across environments and can be learned in simulation through systematic randomization, while perception is inherently domain-specific and must be learned where visual observations are authentic. Unlike existing end-to-end approaches that require extensive real-world data, our method achieves strong performance with only 10-20 real demonstrations by reducing the complex sim-to-real problem to a structured perception alignment task. We validate our approach on tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines.

While latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis, preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions. However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation, leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background, eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.",

Unlike traditional human-written clones, AI-generated clones exhibit systematic syntactic patterns and semantic differences learned from large-scale training data. This shift presents new challenges for classical code clone detection (CCD) tools, which have historically been validated primarily on human-authored codebases and optimized to detect syntactic (Type 1-3) and limited semantic clones. Given that AI-generated code can produce both syntactic and complex semantic clones, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of classical CCD tools within this new paradigm. In this paper, we systematically evaluate nine widely used CCD tools using GPTCloneBench, a benchmark containing GPT-3-generated clones. To contextualize and validate our results, we further test these detectors on established human-authored benchmarks, BigCloneBench and SemanticCloneBench, to measure differences in performance between traditional and AI-generated clones. Our analysis demonstrates that classical CCD tools, particularly those enhanced by effective normalization techniques, retain considerable effectiveness against AI-generated clones, while some exhibit notable performance variation compared to traditional benchmarks. This paper contributes by (1) evaluating classical CCD tools against AI-generated clones, providing critical insights into their current strengths and limitations; (2) highlighting the role of normalization techniques in improving detection accuracy; and (3) delivering detailed scalability and execution-time analyses to support practical CCD tool selection.",

To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm, enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end training of these policies.

In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel environments.",

However, the architectural mechanisms behind such improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore, we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses, we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off: strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations. More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design, emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.",

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy -- models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness, underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing truthful LLMs.",

We present OPPO, a novel, lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g., actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g., reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2) Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines of code change.

When ad ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors, emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained, showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals. We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality. Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied on familiar tropes.

However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods, however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables \"free-lunch\" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved text-to-image alignment.

We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.",

        "abstract": "While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image (T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process, leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality. The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.",

        "abstract": "Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network (ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%).

Building on these advancements, diffusion models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image. However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content manipulation across frames.",

While self-supervised techniques such as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities, their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8\\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks. Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks.",

While accurate, these simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant, physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient operator learning.",

Emergent research shows that ECGs can help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve ECG-based cardiac function prediction.

Through experiments and external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs.

In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO) benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning), underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding; models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.",

Models trained using deep neural networks (DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness. In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity, neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively reduces disparities.",

This paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type, we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized applications.

This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only 4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31% improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's effectiveness in feature discrimination.

To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones, and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models. Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x.

An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation, Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning: Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce Action--Guided Diffusion Policy (DP--AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP--AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle--consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception--action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP--AG significantly outperforms state--of--the--art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP--AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning.",

Existing solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2) the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in reasoning tokens by over 50\\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising a model's underlying reasoning power.",

Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting, but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN) evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500. Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14 settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades. Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS, ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.",

We propose Concrete Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B, OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT.

        "abstract": "Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern: embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces. Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

As tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful, mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it into a \"preventative fine-tuning\", forcing the model to learn a more robust refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis. Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable AI safety.",

However, prior work has found that explanations can easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%, including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.",

Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems, it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories. Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks.

However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation. Viewing each task's exploration as an \"item\" with a distinct \"value\" and \"cost\", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational \"free lunch\", our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.",

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the planner.

        "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) inference requires substantial computational resources, yet CPU-based inference remains essential for democratizing AI due to the widespread availability of CPUs compared to specialized accelerators. However, efficient LLM inference on CPUs faces two fundamental challenges: (1) existing CPU architectures struggle with low-precision arithmetic required by quantized models, where optimal bit precision varies across models and layers; and (2) the memory-bound nature of the token generation phase creates severe performance bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose SAIL (SRAM-Accelerated Inference of LLMs), a CPU-based inference solution that efficiently supports arbitrary bit precisions with minimal overhead. SAIL integrates three key innovations: First, we introduce Batched LUT-based General Matrix-Vector Multiplication (LUT-GEMV) with SRAM-based processing-in-memory, enabling high data reuse through lookup tables and reducing memory movement. Second, our Pattern-Aware LUT optimization identifies and exploits redundancy in input activation patterns, reducing computation cycles by 13.8\\%. Third, we develop an in-memory type conversion algorithm that leverages PIM's parallelism for efficient de-/quantization operations, alleviating pressure on CPU's vector units. Our architecture requires only 2\\% hardware overhead and a single new instruction, while maintaining dual functionality as both compute and storage units. Experimental evaluations using a modified gem5 simulator demonstrate that SAIL achieves up to 10.7x speedup and 19.9x higher tokens per dollar compared to ARM Neoverse-N1 CPU baselines, and up to 7.04x better cost efficiency than NVIDIA V100 GPUs, establishing a practical path for efficient CPU-based LLM inference.",

Though image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods. Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the robustness and compatibility of our approach.",

By invoking visual tools or generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively generates \"visual thoughts\" by operating directly in the visual embedding space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible \"thinking with images\". Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness of the model design.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models' coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent), which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.",

However, on-call engineers are often burdened with manually inspecting massive volumes of logs to identify root causes. While various automated tools have been proposed, they struggle in practice due to alert-agnostic log scoping and the inability to organize complex data effectively for reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LogPilot, an intent-aware and scalable framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log-based alert diagnosis. LogPilot introduces an intent-aware approach, interpreting the logic in alert definitions (e.g., PromQL) to precisely identify causally related logs and requests. To achieve scalability, it reconstructs each request's execution into a spatiotemporal log chain, clusters similar chains to identify recurring execution patterns, and provides representative samples to the LLMs for diagnosis. This clustering-based approach ensures the input is both rich in diagnostic detail and compact enough to fit within the LLM's context window. Evaluated on real-world alerts from Volcano Engine Cloud, LogPilot improves the usefulness of root cause summarization by 50.34% and exact localization accuracy by 54.79% over state-of-the-art methods. With a diagnosis time under one minute and a cost of only $0.074 per alert, LogPilot has been successfully deployed in production, offering an automated and practical solution for service alert diagnosis.",

Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity, we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.",

In this work, we identify four key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal, and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations. Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk, Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm, privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion. Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.",

APR agents automatically fetch GitHub issues and use backend LLMs to generate patches that fix the reported bugs. However, existing work primarily focuses on the functional correctness of APR-generated patches, whether they pass hidden or regression tests, while largely ignoring potential security risks. Given the openness of platforms like GitHub, where any user can raise issues and participate in discussions, an important question arises: Can an adversarial user submit a valid issue on GitHub that misleads an LLM-based agent into generating a functionally correct but vulnerable patch? To answer this question, we propose SWExploit, which generates adversarial issue statements designed to make APR agents produce patches that are functionally correct yet vulnerable. SWExploit operates in three main steps: (1) program analysis to identify potential injection points for vulnerable payloads; (2) adversarial issue generation to provide misleading reproduction and error information while preserving the original issue semantics; and (3) iterative refinement of the adversarial issue statements based on the outputs of the APR agents. Empirical evaluation on three agent pipelines and five backend LLMs shows that SWExploit can produce patches that are both functionally correct and vulnerable (the attack success rate on the correct patch could reach 0.91, whereas the baseline ASRs are all below 0.20). Based on our evaluation, we are the first to challenge the traditional assumption that a patch passing all tests is inherently reliable and secure, highlighting critical limitations in the current evaluation paradigm for APR agents.",

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over 13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations) and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases, revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic religions across most evaluatee models.",

In order to provide immersive user experiences, MAR devices must timely upload camera frames to an edge server for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-based device pose tracking. In this paper, to cope with user-specific and non-stationary uplink data traffic, we develop a digital twin (DT)-based approach for user-centric communication service provision for MAR. Specifically, to establish DTs for individual MAR devices, we first construct a data model customized for MAR that captures the intricate impact of the SLAM-based frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data traffic pattern. We then define two DT operation functions that cooperatively enable adaptive switching between different data-driven models for capturing non-stationary data traffic. Leveraging the user-oriented data management introduced by DTs, we propose an algorithm for network resource management that ensures the timeliness of frame uploading and the robustness against inherent inaccuracies in data traffic modeling for individual MAR devices. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that the user-centric communication service provision achieves a 14.2% increase in meeting the camera frame uploading delay requirement in comparison with the slicing-based communication service provision widely used for 5G.",

Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.",

        "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\\mathrm{Softmax}$ as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using $\\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN) and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression, where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer. Motivated by these insights, we propose the \\textbf{zero-additional-cost} Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function, as an alternative to $\\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router generalizes both $\\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers. \\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN implementation, we recommend the use of $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and $\\ell_2$-normalization in $\\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style router function \\methodNorm.",

This failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved without compromising the base model's general visual understanding capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning and fine-grained visual grounding.",

To address this challenge, we present StorInfer, a novel storage-assisted LLM inference system that accelerates response time by precomputing and storing predictable query-response pairs offline. When a user query semantically matches a precomputed query, StorInfer bypasses expensive GPU inference and instantly returns the stored response, significantly reducing latency and compute costs. To maximize coverage and effectiveness, StorInfer employs an LLM-driven generator that adaptively produces diverse and deduplicated queries based on a given knowledge base. This is achieved via two techniques: adaptive query masking, which prevents regeneration of similar queries, and adaptive sampling, which dynamically tunes generation parameters to promote semantic diversity. The resulting query-response pairs are embedded and indexed using a disk-backed vector database to enable fast, similarity-based retrieval at runtime. Using this approach, we generated 150K unique precomputed pairs (taking up to 830 MB of storage space), achieving up to 17.3% latency reduction with no loss in response quality. Our evaluation across multiple QA datasets demonstrates the practicality and scalability of storage-assisted inference, especially in scenarios with predictable query distributions. StorInfer highlights a promising direction in leveraging storage as a primary enabler for efficient, low-latency LLM deployment.",

Multi-layer nested JSON structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying. For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata (title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information (multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However, current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring 2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to advance research in structured JSON generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).",

As such, LLMs are now a key driver behind the automation of language processing systems, such as AI agents. Unfortunately, these advantages have come with a vulnerability to prompt injections, an attack where an adversary subverts the LLM's intended functionality with an injected task. Past approaches have proposed detectors and finetuning to provide robustness, but these techniques are vulnerable to adaptive attacks or cannot be used with state-of-the-art models. To this end we propose type-directed privilege separation for LLMs, a method that systematically prevents prompt injections. We restrict the ability of an LLM to interact with third-party data by converting untrusted content to a curated set of data types; unlike raw strings, each data type is limited in scope and content, eliminating the possibility for prompt injections. We evaluate our method across several case studies and find that designs leveraging our principles can systematically prevent prompt injection attacks while maintaining high utility.",

We begin with common failure cases-prompts like \"a cat and a dog\" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt. The goal is to steer towards \"pure\" joint modes where all concepts can coexist with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance; we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion systems.",

By estimating the solvability of each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate solvability into their objectives.

Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View (BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations, enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency. To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to 41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.",

To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp), a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains: reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to 52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance impact.",

A general theory is difficult. We discuss several possibilities: if the solution is represented by average in volumes; if the mesh is staggerred; if the solution is solely represented by point values and an example where all the previous options are mixed.\nWe show how each configuration can provide, or not, enough flexibility. The discussion could be adapted to any hyperbolic system endowed with an entropy, but we focus on compressible fluid mechanics, in its Eulerian and Lagrangian formulations. The unifying element is that we systematically express the update of conserved variables as $u^{n+1}=u^n- \\Delta t\\; \\delta u$, where the functional $\\delta u$ depends on the value of $u$ in the stencil of the scheme. Then, one can naturally define a graph connecting the states defining $\\delta u$. The notion of local conservation can be defined from this graph. We are aware of only two possible situations: either the graph is constructed from the faces of the mesh elements (or the dual mesh), or it is defined from the mesh itself. Two notions of local conservation then emerge: either we define a numerical flux, or we define a \"residual\" attached to elements and the degrees of freedom within the element. We show that this two notions are in a way equivalent, but the one with residual allows much more flexibility, especially if additional algebraic constraints must be satisfied. Examples of specific additional conservation constraints are provided to illustrate this. We also show that this notion of conservation gives a very clear framework for the design of scheme in the Lagrangian framework. We end by providing a number of ongoing research questions, and highlight some open questions.",

Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability. To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions (CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision. By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world applications.",

As autonomous AI agents become increasingly prevalent in digital systems, there is a critical need for standardized protocols to establish agent identity, verify agent attestation, represent delegation chains, and enable fine-grained authorization based on agent attributes. This specification defines standard claims, endpoints, and protocols that address these requirements while maintaining compatibility with existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect infrastructure. The proposed framework introduces mechanisms for agent identity representation, delegation chain validation, attestation verification, and capability-based authorization, providing a foundation for secure and trustworthy agent-to-service interactions in modern distributed systems.",

In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2) exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks; and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.",

In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to explore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body only, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness) displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's behavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that children aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state. However, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment.

Current approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13 strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function. Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by 228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the efficacy.",

Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios, however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection.",

In this paper, we propose Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or \"N:M\") sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training, while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format. Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns; 3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally, we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.",

To tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.",

Our contribution is the planar Signorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general planar contacts between rigid bodies. We prove that this formulation is equivalent to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across an entire contact surface, thereby bridging the gap between discrete and continuous contact models. A geometric interpretation reveals that the framework naturally captures three physical regimes -sticking, separating, and tilting-within a unified complementarity structure. This leads to a principled extension of the classical center of pressure, which we refer to as the extended center of pressure. By establishing this connection, our work provides a mathematically consistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar contacts, with implications for both the accurate simulation of contact dynamics and the design of advanced control and optimization algorithms in locomotion and manipulation.",

In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are both practical and theoretically sound.",

However, progress in this area is currently hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about manipulated objects (e.g., \"I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to the pan\"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise annotations.",

Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions, user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner. AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection, distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.",

The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI) is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair comparison across grayscale and color images.

Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1) union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues, carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary semantic relevance judgments (\"Yes/No\"), which goes beyond CLIP's global feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR, Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.",

        "abstract": "In the domain of Project Management, the sheer volume of data is a challenge that project managers continually have to deal with. Effectively steering projects from inception to completion requires handling of diverse information streams, including timelines, budgetary considerations, and task dependencies. To navigate this data-driven landscape with precision and agility, project managers must rely on efficient and sophisticated tools. These tools have become essential, as they enable project managers to streamline communication, optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions in real-time. However, many of these tools have steep learning curves and require using complex programming languages to retrieve the exact data that project managers need. In this work we present JiraGPT Next, a software that uses the GPT Large Language Model to ease the process by which project managers deal with large amounts of data. It is conceived as an add-on for Jira, one of the most popular Project Management tools, and provides a natural language interface to retrieve information. This work presents the design decisions behind JiraGPT Next and an evaluation of the accuracy of GPT in this context, including the effects of providing different prompts to complete a particular task.",

General-purpose language models often lack domain-specific knowledge and tend to \"hallucinate\", which is particularly harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible, unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability, visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in addressing climate-related challenges.

However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR. This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512 resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.",

This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output (VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view, we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings, whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.",

This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated, making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge, a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment. Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision, combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection. Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods, particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots).

However, existing methods predominantly rely on text similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.",

Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \\emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.",

Fabricated images and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal, text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories: FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with FG-BG inconsistencies.

We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search. Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Most existing approaches rely on manually designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks. While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse domains.

A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment.",

Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization. Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/lens",

However, existing network designs will struggle to handle the demands of 6G, which include much faster speeds, a huge increase in connected devices, lower energy consumption, extremely quick response times, and better mobile broadband. To solve this problem, incorporating the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has been proposed. This idea led to the concept of Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN). KDN promises many improvements, such as resource management, routing, scheduling, clustering, and mobility prediction.

However, existing benchmarks are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment: models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions, but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems. Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation, achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next generation of LLMs.",

However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation, and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.",

Traditionally, robot design has followed a sequential process, where control algorithms are developed after the hardware is finalized. However, this can be myopic and prevent robots to fully exploit their hardware capabilities. Recent approaches advocate for co-design, optimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic capabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based Co-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with evolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy to the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which explores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify efficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a task-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance rewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and control policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task, previously unfeasible due to actuator limitations. Comparative results against state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods show that EA-CoRL achieves higher fitness score and broader design space exploration, highlighting the critical role of continuous policy adaptation in robot co-design.",

These models utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis, cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\\%, from 9.73 to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc, achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels, avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71 mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\\%. These findings highlight the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene understanding.",

With the strong reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical strategy optimization.",

Although gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

This paper introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of advanced AI.",

Our survey of 35 existing benchmarks uncovers three major imbalances: 85.7% focus on a single programming language; 94.3% target only function-level or statement-level tasks; and over 80% include fewer than ten test cases on average. To address these gaps, we propose MultiOOP, a multi-language object-oriented programming benchmark covering six popular languages (Python, PHP, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript) with 267 tasks per language. We design a translator that extends an existing single-language OOP benchmark and the pass@o metric to a multilingual setting. Moreover, we propose an automated framework for augmenting test cases to ensure the reliability of the evaluation results. We evaluate 14 mainstream LLMs under zero-shot prompting and report three key findings: 1) Substantial performance degradation: pass@1 scores on MultiOOP drop by up to 65.6 percentage points compared to function-level tasks (e.g., HumanEval). 2) Cross-language variability: GPT-4o mini achieves pass@1 of 48.06% in Python but only 0.12%-15.26% in other languages, indicating limited multilingual generalization. 3) Conceptual gaps: pass@o scores are consistently 1.1-19.2 points lower than pass@k, demonstrating that LLMs often generate executable code without fully capturing core OOP concepts. Our benchmark, metric extensions, and evaluation scripts will be publicly released to foster a more balanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs in object-oriented code generation.

However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy, while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.",

Our approach naturally models sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more flexible separation of bins/clusters.

To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of tokens as before.\nEvaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.",

This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.",

They either rely on computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity. We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition. Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling latency. Code and models will be released soon.",

        "abstract": "Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically, signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than 40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.",

Some of the existing learning algorithms cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting. As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way. By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational demands.",

This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the $\\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present $\\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to multi-step reasoning, $\\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and release $\\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new $\\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean DoA error by $\\textbf{11$^{\\circ}$}$ through $\\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\\textbf{25}$\\% over BAT.",

Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series modeling.

Recently, researchers have begun to explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.\nTo bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also reduces development time by 91.4%.

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability. Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage. 2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945 real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image understanding.

This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of \"thick description,\" we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect deeper cultural meanings--what we term \"thick outputs\"-grounded firmly in user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations, the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.",

Parallax decomposes planning into (i) model allocation, which places layers of each replica across diverse GPUs to jointly optimize latency and throughput under memory and link-bandwidth constraints, and (ii) request-time GPU pipeline selection, which stitches layers from different replicas into end-to-end execution chains that balance load and adapt to current conditions. We implement Parallax and evaluate it on open-source LLMs deployed over real volunteer nodes. Parallax consistently reduces latency and increases throughput relative to decentralized baselines, demonstrating that principled scheduling can make volunteer compute a practical, affordable substrate for LLM inference.\nGithub Repo at: https://github.com/GradientHQ/parallax.",

The system comprises specialized RAN (energy efficiency) and Edge (latency assurance) agents that engage in iterative negotiation, supported by advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. Agents dynamically interact with a digital twin (DT) to test their proposals and leverage a long-term collective memory where their joint successful and failed agreements along with the related network contexts are distilled into strategies to either follow or avoid and subsequently stored. Given that agents are subject to a plethora of cognitive distortions when retrieving those past experiences -- such as primacy, recency, confirmation and availability biases -- we propose in this work a novel unbiased memory design (A reusable mockup version of the unbiased memory source code is available for non-commercial use at https://github.com/HatimChergui/unbiased-collective-memory). featuring (i) semantic retrieval of past strategies via Jaccard similarity; (ii) learning from failures through amplified weighting of SLA violations and mandatory inclusion of failed negotiation cases to mitigate confirmation bias; (iii) diversity enforcement to minimize availability bias and (iv) recency and primacy weighting with slow decay to counteract temporal biases. Evaluation results showcase the impact of existing biases and how the unbiased memory allows to tackle them by learning from both successful and failed strategies, either present or old, resulting in $\\times 4.5$ and $\\times 3.5$ reductions of unresolved negotiations compared to non-memory and vanilla memory baselines, respectively, while totally mitigating SLA violations as well as improving latency and energy saving distributions.",

We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions. Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting textual format variations.

The resulting smooth terrain manifold enables ``soft constraints\" that regularize the odometry optimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation changes during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we further evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse kernel matrix with GPU parallelization.

Following, we focus on one of the most desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating plausible textual explanations for video summarization.",

In this work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt, IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c) formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter, seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods.

Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming, requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators. Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between high fidelity and diversity.

Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have come to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors and 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source hands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and attempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce the open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost, easy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be assembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD. The ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with only a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the articulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand to perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our novel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the two most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform similarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly outperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a policy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its ability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.",

However, traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial: by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can \"buy\" stronger guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than their black-box counterparts.

However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training. In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by 91.0% compared to the vanilla method.",

This data heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or communication efficiency.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves up to a $2.8\\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high resource efficiency.",

Such factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames.

We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

In this paper, we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment (PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences: 66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.",

This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives, aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and adaptation methods.

However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components: Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion, before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales, evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.",

However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding (AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive, entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.

In this work, we posit that this performance disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.",

Recent work instead proposes a latent thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains, and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general, efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of LLMs.",

In this work, we propose Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask, enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR decoding without compromising generation quality.

        "abstract": "Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality. In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.",

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios, consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively, defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered, GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average planning time.",

However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving performance by over 40\\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\\% when generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.",

Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.",

The main bottleneck is the lack of a reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To address this critical bottleneck, we built \\mname, trained with our new large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \\mname demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided image editing tasks. Experiments show that \\mname achieves state-of-the-art human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench, ImagenHub, and our new \\benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge models. Furthermore, we use \\mname to select a high-quality subset from the existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This demonstrates \\mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \\mname with its training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality image editing training datasets.",

Yet these scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers, transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.\nWe address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and (ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes. Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by (i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii) prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.\nWe further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses, illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in clinical AI.",

However, self-evolution also introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways, leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy self-evolving agents.

This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this paper, we propose the first general method for modelling SchrÃ¶dinger bridges when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities, with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data SchrÃ¶dinger bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method.

Configuring an optimized TSN network is highly challenging, requiring careful planning, design, verification, validation, and deployment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks, positioning them as promising candidates for automating end-to-end TSN deployment, referred to as TSN orchestration. This paper outlines the steps involved in TSN orchestration and the associated challenges. To assess the capabilities of existing LLM models, we conduct an initial proof-of-concept case study focused on TSN configuration across multiple models. Building on these insights, we propose an LLM-assisted orchestration framework. Unlike prior research on LLMs in computer networks, which has concentrated on general configuration and management, TSN-specific orchestration has not yet been investigated. We present the building blocks for automating TSN using LLMs, describe the proposed pipeline, and analyze opportunities and limitations for real-world deployment. Finally, we highlight key challenges and research directions, including the development of TSN-focused datasets, standardized benchmark suites, and the integration of external tools such as Network Calculus (NC) engines and simulators.

To bridge this gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i) Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3) successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in challenging scenarios.",

To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.",

This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture; (iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of realistic motion dynamics.",

Despite enormous potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they often introduce a \\emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur \\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{F}ederated \\textbf{Lo}w-\\textbf{R}ank \\textbf{A}ggregation with \\textbf{N}early \\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\\nabla \\Bar{W} = \\sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\\nabla \\hat{W} = \\hat{B}\\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication overhead.",

Existing methods typically extract post-hoc signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters -- properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training, enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications. Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.",

While recent advances have focused on large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models, which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and adaptive strategies.",

However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing. Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free, plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.",

In practice, the interdependence among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior control performance, outperforming all competitors.",

Although 8-bit outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in 4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations, leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression (QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.",

In most cases of immersive robotic telepresence, the camera is mounted on a mobile robot which increases the portion of the environment that the remote user can explore. However, robot motions can induce unpleasant symptoms associated with Virtual Reality (VR) sickness, degrading the overall user experience. Previous research has shown that unwinding the rotations of the robot, that is, decoupling the rotations that the camera undergoes due to robot motions from what is seen by the user, can increase user comfort and reduce VR sickness. However, that work considered a virtual environment and a simulated robot. In this work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from a real camera is used, we carried out a user study $(n=36)$ in which the unwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task completed through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore, within an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three dimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the performance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding rotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced level of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task performance.",

This limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in stochastic approximation and RL.

CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10 narrative indicators measuring both quality and length.

We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly, ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG.

Error wrapping, a practice prevalent in modern microservice development, enriches errors with context at each layer of the function call stack, constructing an error chain that describes a failure from its technical origin to its business impact. However, this also presents a significant traceability problem when recovering the complete error propagation path from the final log message back to its source. Existing approaches are ineffective at addressing this problem. To fill this gap, we present ErrorPrism in this work for automated reconstruction of error propagation paths in production microservice systems. ErrorPrism first performs static analysis on service code repositories to build a function call graph and map log strings to relevant candidate functions. This significantly reduces the path search space for subsequent analysis. Then, ErrorPrism employs an LLM agent to perform an iterative backward search to accurately reconstruct the complete, multi-hop error path. Evaluated on 67 production microservices at ByteDance, ErrorPrism achieves 97.0% accuracy in reconstructing paths for 102 real-world errors, outperforming existing static analysis and LLM-based approaches. ErrorPrism provides an effective and practical tool for root cause analysis in industrial microservice systems.",

Drawing on over 6,000 student submissions collected across four years of an introductory programming course, we systematically analysed the distribution of grades, differences in mean scores and variability reflecting stricter or more lenient grading, and the consistency and clustering of grading patterns across models. Eighteen publicly available models were evaluated: Anthropic (claude-3-5-haiku, claude-opus-4-1, claude-sonnet-4); Deepseek (deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner); Google (gemini-2.0-flash-lite, gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro); and OpenAI (gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4.1, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5). Statistical tests, correlation and clustering analyses revealed clear, systematic differences between and within vendor families, with \"mini\" and \"nano\" variants consistently underperforming their full-scale counterparts. All models displayed high internal agreement, measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient, with the model consensus but only moderate agreement with human teachers' grades, indicating a persistent gap between automated and human assessment. These findings underscore that the choice of model for educational deployment is not neutral and should be guided by pedagogical goals, transparent reporting of evaluation metrics, and ongoing human oversight to ensure accuracy, fairness and relevance.",

Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel, a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/czg1225/dParallel",

Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods.",

To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools. Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator, enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical real-world applications.

While most studies and global discussions focus on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval, an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\\% -- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in the 62--73\\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\\%), and Gemma and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\\% and 23.84\\%, respectively. While operational safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground provides consistent gains of up to 23\\%, while P-ground delivers even larger boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\\%. These results highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based agents.",

BDH couples strong theoretical foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like performance.\nBDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space sequence learning architecture.

It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws: empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.\nBDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human neurons could use to achieve speech.\nBDH is designed for interpretability.

However, existing approaches often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a ``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual ``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.",

Building on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that enables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders of magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while maintaining comparable uniformity.

However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE (M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking: top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail. We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE models.",

While these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally, we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\\% over traditional approaches. Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter lifecycle for the future.",

Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.

HilbertA delivers attention speedups of $2.3\\times$ when generating $1024\\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\\times$ at $2048\\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing baselines.",

The mainstream sequence parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency, restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.\nInspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

This prevents the agent from being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug, improves readability, implements a feature).\nAs a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.\nWe applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8 incorrect judgments made by the agent.",

However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs) provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth, and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3% for GPT-5.",

Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera. Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+ models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.",

This work proposes a multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.",

        "abstract": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome. Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling, the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison. Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.",

Beyond known attack vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B), each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs without compromising fairness or reliability.",

The LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its generation of difficult examples.

We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4 points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39% if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit annotations.",

This becomes problematic when the applied blur is undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography and generative AI applications.",

While these generated test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator), with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed self bias.",

To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423 human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping, and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.",

We provide the first principled analysis of this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency.

We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.",

Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by 18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world settings. Code and models will be released.",

These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.",

Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains -- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA.

In this paper, we introduce a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size, ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training pipeline for PSRL.

However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover, preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30 seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks, without any learning curriculum.",

The benchmark contains approximately 2000 videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).

In this paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors. We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale. This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify components that are responsible for this.

We contend that in current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism. Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods in several cases.",

        "abstract": "Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs) and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

        "abstract": "Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years, but accurately capturing spatial relationships like \"above\" or \"to the right of\" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models. We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top models still have significant room for improvement in position-based generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206% on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while integrating position control into leading models training-free.

        "abstract": "Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for 3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the 3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective, framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates, to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially improves length generalization, achieving a $2\\times$ improvement in global pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU memory to process thousands of images.

To address this, we introduce MatterMech, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated hypotheses across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. Our analysis reveals a critical disconnect: LLMs are proficient in abstract logic yet fail to ground their reasoning in fundamental physicochemical principles. We demonstrate that our proposed principle-aware prompting methodology substantially outperforms standard Chain-of-Thought, enhancing both hypothesis accuracy and computational efficiency. This work provides a methodological framework to advance LLMs toward reliable scientific hypothesis generation in materials science.

        "abstract": "Cellular wireless systems are witnessing the proliferation of frequency bands over a wide spectrum, particularly with the expansion of new bands in FR3. These bands must be supported in user equipment (UE) handsets with multiple antennas in a constrained form factor. Rapid variations in channel quality across the bands from motion and hand blockage, limited field-of-view of antennas, and hardware and power-constrained measurement sparsity pose significant challenges to reliable multi-band channel tracking. This paper formulates the problem of predicting achievable rates across multiple antenna arrays and bands with sparse historical measurements. We propose a transformer-based neural architecture that takes asynchronous rate histories as input and outputs per-array rate predictions. Evaluated on ray-traced simulations in a dense urban micro-cellular setting with FR1 and FR3 arrays, our method demonstrates superior performance over baseline predictors, enabling more informed band selection under realistic mobility and hardware constraints.",

        "abstract": "Test-time training (TTT) enhances model performance by explicitly updating designated parameters prior to each prediction to adapt to the test data. While TTT has demonstrated considerable empirical success, its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly for nonlinear models. In this paper, we investigate the combination of TTT with in-context learning (ICL), where the model is given a few examples from the target distribution at inference time. We analyze this framework in the setting of single-index models $y=\\sigma_*(\\langle \\beta, \\mathbf{x} \\rangle)$, where the feature vector $\\beta$ is drawn from a hidden low-dimensional subspace. For single-layer transformers trained with gradient-based algorithms and adopting TTT, we establish an upper bound on the prediction risk. Our theory reveals that TTT enables the single-layer transformers to adapt to both the feature vector $\\beta$ and the link function $\\sigma_*$, which vary across tasks. This creates a sharp contrast with ICL alone, which is theoretically difficult to adapt to shifts in the link function. Moreover, we provide the convergence rate with respect to the data length, showing the predictive error can be driven arbitrarily close to the noise level as the context size and the network width grow.",

This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding), a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese \"soundmarks.\" TAU is built through a pipeline combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation, producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the global mainstream.",

In particular, computational High-Energy Physics tasks such as jet tagging and particle track reconstruction (tracking), have either achieved proper solutions, or reached considerable milestones using Transformers. On the other hand, the use of specialised hardware accelerators, especially FPGAs, is an effective method to achieve online, or pseudo-online latencies. The development and integration of Transformer-based ML to FPGAs is still ongoing and the support from current tools is very limited to non-existent. Additionally, FPGA resources present a significant constraint. Considering the model size alone, while smaller models can be deployed directly, larger models are to be partitioned in a meaningful and ideally, automated way. We aim to develop methodologies and tools for monolithic, or partitioned Transformer synthesis, specifically targeting inference. Our primary use-case involves two machine learning model designs for tracking, derived from the TrackFormers project. We elaborate our development approach, present preliminary results, and provide comparisons.",

In this work, we study how the structure of pretraining tasks governs generalization in ICL. Using a solvable model for ICL of linear regression by linear attention, we derive an exact expression for ICL generalization error in high dimensions under arbitrary pretraining-testing task covariance mismatch. This leads to a new alignment measure that quantifies how much information about the pretraining task distribution is useful for inference at test time. We show that this measure directly predicts ICL performance not only in the solvable model but also in nonlinear Transformers. Our analysis further reveals a tradeoff between specialization and generalization in ICL: depending on task distribution alignment, increasing pretraining task diversity can either improve or harm test performance. Together, these results identify train-test task alignment as a key determinant of generalization in ICL.",
