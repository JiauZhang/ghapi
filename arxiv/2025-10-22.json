        "abstract": "Unlicensed 6GHz is becoming a primary workhorse for high-capacity access, with Wi-Fi and 5G NR-U competing for the same channels under listen-before-talk (LBT) rules. Operating in this regime requires decisions that jointly trade throughput, energy, and service-level objectives while remaining safe and auditable. We present an agentic controller that separates {policy} from {execution}. At the start of each scheduling epoch the agent summarizes telemetry (per-channel busy and baseline LBT failure; per-user CQI, backlog, latency, battery, priority, and power mode) and invokes a large language model (LLM) to propose a small set of interpretable knobs: a fairness index \\alpha, per-channel duty-cycle caps for Wi-Fi/NR-U, and class weights. A deterministic optimizer then enforces feasibility and computes an \\alpha-fair allocation that internalizes LBT losses and energy cost; malformed or unsafe policies are clamped and fall back to a rule baseline. In a 6GHz simulator with two 160MHz channels and mixed Wi-Fi/NR-U users, LLM-assisted policies consistently improve energy efficiency while keeping throughput competitive with a strong rule baseline. One LLM lowers total energy by 35.3% at modest throughput loss, and another attains the best overall trade-off, finishing with higher total bits (+3.5%) and higher bits/J (+12.2%) than the baseline. We release code, per-epoch logs, and plotting utilities to reproduce all figures and numbers, illustrating how transparent, policy-level LLM guidance can safely improve wireless coexistence.",

Despite near a century since the transistor's invention, the understanding of transistor switching remains fragmented: switching is treated as a black box relying on observed waveforms, cannot be explained using physical laws alone, and is not integrated into circuit theory. This forms one of the most critical barriers to recognizing the true physical boundaries, prohibiting more sustainable solutions. For example, the conventional Eon prediction model, derived from the conventional switching analysis, exhibits significant prediction errors (ranging from 34.41% to 80.05%). Here we present a unified first-principles paradigm to explain the switching phenomena. Using this paradigm, we revealed the physical origins and mechanisms of switching-ON phenomena across scenarios, and derived the proposed Eon prediction model, with error ranging from 0.88% to 11.60%, achieving a 17-fold average improvement. These results demonstrate the unprecedented power of the proposed paradigm: textbook-level foundations are established, transforming the fundamental understanding of transistor switching from empirical to first-principles analysis, and simultaneously stimulating follow-up research and applications for sustainable development across disciplines.",

An intelligent agent then transforms those specifications into executable software. We formalize the definition of vibe coding and propose a reference architecture that includes an intent parser, a semantic embedding engine, an agentic code generator, and an interactive feedback loop. A hypothetical implementation is described. We compare vibe coding with declarative, functional, and prompt-based programming, and we discuss its implications for software engineering, human-AI collaboration, and responsible AI practice.

We introduce GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches. Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from 0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10) rises from 0.807 to 0.857..

Existing data selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due to separate treatment of importance and diversity.\nWe introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set, drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.\nIn our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on average.",

In this paper, we introduce RiskTagger, a large-language-model-based agent for the automatic annotation of crypto laundering behaviors in Web3. RiskTagger is designed to replace or complement human annotators by addressing three key challenges: extracting clues from complex unstructured reports, reasoning over multichain transaction paths, and producing auditor-friendly explanations. RiskTagger implements an end-to-end multi-module agent, integrating a key-clue extractor, a multichain fetcher with a laundering-behavior reasoner, and a data explainer, forming a data annotation pipeline. Experiments on the real case Bybit Hack (with the highest stolen asset value) demonstrate that RiskTagger achieves 100% accuracy in clue extraction, 84.1% consistency with expert judgment, and 90% coverage in explanation generation. Overall, RiskTagger automates laundering behavior annotation while improving transparency and scalability in AML research.",

LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication. Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that balances accuracy with computational efficiency.",

Working on the velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g., producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.",

To tackle these limitations, we propose DMTrack, a deformable motion tracking framework tailored for UAV-based MOT. Our DMTrack introduces three key components: DeformMamba, a deformable state-space predictor that dynamically aggregates historical motion states for adaptive trajectory modeling; MotionGate, a lightweight gating module that fuses Kalman and Mamba predictions based on motion context and uncertainty; and an uncertainty-aware association strategy that enhances identity preservation by aligning motion trends with prediction confidence. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone-MOT and UAVDT benchmarks demonstrate that our DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity consistency and tracking accuracy, particularly under high-speed and non-linear motion. Importantly, our method operates without appearance models and maintains competitive efficiency, highlighting its practicality for robust UAV-based tracking.",

This study explores the generation of realistic, handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic score generation.",

These tool calls often fail for various syntactic and semantic reasons. Some less obvious semantic errors can only be identified and resolved after analyzing the tool's response. To repair these errors, we develop a post-tool execution reflection component that combines large language model (LLM)-based reflection with domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using documents describing both the specific tool being called and troubleshooting documents related to the tool. For this paper, we focus on the use case of the kubectl command line tool to manage Kubernetes, a platform for orchestrating cluster applications. Through a larger empirical study and a smaller manual evaluation, we find that our RAG-based reflection will repair kubectl commands such that they are both more likely to successfully execute (pass rate) for 55% of our models evaluated and 36% more likely to correctly answer the user query on average. We find that troubleshooting documents improve pass rate compared to official documentation by an average of 10%.",

Previous works mainly employ class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage, ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models. Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.",

We tested this using altruistic third-party punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness, a hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting; and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost, enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity, whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven. These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should integrate emotion with context-sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like emotional intelligence.",

Nevertheless, existing alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) largely optimize toward population-level averages and overlook individual variation. Naive personalization strategies like per-user fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, and in-context approaches that prepend raw user signals often suffer from inefficiency and noise. To address these challenges, we propose POPI, a general framework that introduces a preference inference model to distill heterogeneous user signals into concise natural language summaries. These summaries act as transparent, compact, and transferable personalization representations that condition a shared generation model to produce personalized responses. POPI jointly optimizes both preference inference and personalized generation under a unified objective using reinforcement learning, ensuring summaries maximally encode useful preference information. Extensive experiments across four personalization benchmarks demonstrate that POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while reducing context overhead by a large margin. Moreover, optimized summaries seamlessly transfer to frozen off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling plug-and-play personalization without weight updates.",

Generative large language models (LLMs) introduce a further potential disruption by altering how manuscripts are written. While speculation abounds, systematic evidence of whether and how LLMs reshape scientific publishing remains limited.\nThis paper addresses the gap through a large-scale analysis of more than 2.1 million preprints spanning 2016--2025 (115 months) across four major repositories (i.e., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SocArXiv). We introduce a multi-level analytical framework that integrates interrupted time-series models, collaboration and productivity metrics, linguistic profiling, and topic modeling to assess changes in volume, authorship, style, and disciplinary orientation. Our findings reveal that LLMs have accelerated submission and revision cycles, modestly increased linguistic complexity, and disproportionately expanded AI-related topics, while computationally intensive fields benefit more than others. These results show that LLMs act less as universal disruptors than as selective catalysts, amplifying existing strengths and widening disciplinary divides. By documenting these dynamics, the paper provides the first empirical foundation for evaluating the influence of generative AI on academic publishing and highlights the need for governance frameworks that preserve trust, fairness, and accountability in an AI-enabled research ecosystem.",

In this study, we conduct an empirical investigation into the efficacy of pre-trained LLMs for password cracking using synthetic user profiles. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art open-source LLMs such as TinyLLaMA, Falcon-RW-1B, and Flan-T5 by prompting them to generate plausible passwords based on structured user attributes (e.g., name, birthdate, hobbies). Our results, measured using Hit@1, Hit@5, and Hit@10 metrics under both plaintext and SHA-256 hash comparisons, reveal consistently poor performance, with all models achieving less than 1.5% accuracy at Hit@10. In contrast, traditional rule-based and combinator-based cracking methods demonstrate significantly higher success rates. Through detailed analysis and visualization, we identify key limitations in the generative reasoning of LLMs when applied to the domain-specific task of password guessing. Our findings suggest that, despite their linguistic prowess, current LLMs lack the domain adaptation and memorization capabilities required for effective password inference, especially in the absence of supervised fine-tuning on leaked password datasets. This study provides critical insights into the limitations of LLMs in adversarial contexts and lays the groundwork for future efforts in secure, privacy-preserving, and robust password modeling.",

In this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective, thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and specialized language models.",

To probe beyond multiple-choice questions, we also include a lawyer-graded, paired-blinded study of long-form answers from the Supreme Court's Advocate-on-Record exam. This is, to our knowledge, the first exam-grounded, India-specific yardstick for LLM court-readiness released with datasets and protocols. Our work shows that while frontier systems consistently clear historical cutoffs and often match or exceed recent top-scorer bands on objective exams, none surpasses the human topper on long-form reasoning. Grader notes converge on three reliability failure modes: procedural or format compliance, authority or citation discipline, and forum-appropriate voice and structure. These findings delineate where LLMs can assist (checks, cross-statute consistency, statute and precedent lookups) and where human leadership remains essential: forum-specific drafting and filing, procedural and relief strategy, reconciling authorities and exceptions, and ethical, accountable judgment.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen \"behavioral kernel.\" It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back. This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data, effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We demonstrate that CAST enables true \"zero-shot\" translation of any standard LoRA adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve 85-95\\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model, quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.",

In this paper, we investigate this vulnerability through BreakFun, a jailbreak methodology that weaponizes an LLM's adherence to structured schemas. BreakFun employs a three-part prompt that combines an innocent framing and a Chain-of-Thought distraction with a core \"Trojan Schema\"--a carefully crafted data structure that compels the model to generate harmful content, exploiting the LLM's strong tendency to follow structures and schemas. We demonstrate this vulnerability is highly transferable, achieving an average success rate of 89% across 13 foundational and proprietary models on JailbreakBench, and reaching a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on several prominent models. A rigorous ablation study confirms this Trojan Schema is the attack's primary causal factor. To counter this, we introduce the Adversarial Prompt Deconstruction guardrail, a defense that utilizes a secondary LLM to perform a \"Literal Transcription\"--extracting all human-readable text to isolate and reveal the user's true harmful intent. Our proof-of-concept guardrail demonstrates high efficacy against the attack, validating that targeting the deceptive schema is a viable mitigation strategy. Our work provides a look into how an LLM's core strengths can be turned into critical weaknesses, offering a fresh perspective for building more robustly aligned models.",

We find 27,122 statistically significant discriminative neurons ($p < 0.05$), with effect sizes up to $|d| = 1.4$. Through systematic ablation studies, we discover a paradoxical result: while these neurons correlate with literary text during analysis, removing them often improves rather than degrades generated prose quality. Specifically, ablating 50 high-discriminating neurons yields a 25.7% improvement in literary style metrics. This demonstrates a critical gap between observational correlation and causal necessity in neural networks.

Conventional evaluation methods largely focus on final answer accuracy and overlook the reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a novel interpretability framework for analyzing LLM-generated solutions using undergraduate calculus problems as a representative domain. Our approach combines reasoning flow extraction and decomposing solutions into semantically labeled operations and concepts with prompt ablation analysis to assess input salience and output stability. Using structured metrics such as reasoning complexity, phrase sensitivity, and robustness, we evaluated the model behavior on real Calculus I to III university exams. Our findings revealed that LLMs often produce syntactically fluent yet conceptually flawed solutions, with reasoning patterns sensitive to prompt phrasing and input variation. This framework enables fine-grained diagnosis of reasoning failures, supports curriculum alignment, and informs the design of interpretable AI-assisted feedback tools. This is the first study to offer a structured, quantitative, and pedagogically grounded framework for interpreting LLM reasoning in mathematics education, laying the foundation for the transparent and responsible deployment of AI in STEM learning environments.",

We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers.

Unlike concept unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks. Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation and unlearning performance.",

        "abstract": "The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs) are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training, involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism. In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.",

Currently, traditional detection methods primarily rely on static analysis and formal verification, which can result in high false-positive rates and poor scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently made significant progress in smart contract vulnerability detection. However, they still face challenges such as high inference costs and substantial computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ParaVul, a parallel LLM and retrieval-augmented framework to improve the reliability and accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we first develop Sparse Low-Rank Adaptation (SLoRA) for LLM fine-tuning. SLoRA introduces sparsification by incorporating a sparse matrix into quantized LoRA-based LLMs, thereby reducing computational overhead and resource requirements while enhancing their ability to understand vulnerability-related issues. We then construct a vulnerability contract dataset and develop a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates dense retrieval with Best Matching 25 (BM25), assisting in verifying the results generated by the LLM. Furthermore, we propose a meta-learning model to fuse the outputs of the RAG system and the LLM, thereby generating the final detection results. After completing vulnerability detection, we design chain-of-thought prompts to guide LLMs to generate comprehensive vulnerability detection reports. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of ParaVul, especially in terms of F1 scores, achieving 0.9398 for single-label detection and 0.9330 for multi-label detection.",

However, despite these improvements in task accuracy, the assessment of creativity in LLM generations has been largely overlooked in reasoning tasks, in contrast to writing tasks. The lack of research on creativity assessment in reasoning primarily stems from two challenges: (1) the difficulty of defining the range of creativity, and (2) the necessity of human evaluation in the assessment process. To address these challenges, we propose CLAWS, a method that defines and classifies mathematical solutions into typical, creative, and hallucinated categories without human evaluation, by leveraging attention weights across prompt sections and output. CLAWS outperforms five existing white-box detection methods (Perplexity, Logit Entropy, Window Entropy, Hidden Score, and Attention Score) on five 7-8B math RL models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Mathstral, OpenMath2, and Oreal).

Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition: categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the results through a verification module.

However, current RL methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision. Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward (DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience.",

We address this limitation with SpecAgent, an agent that improves both latency and code-generation quality by proactively exploring repository files during indexing and constructing speculative context that anticipates future edits in each file. This indexing-time asynchrony allows thorough context computation, masking latency, and the speculative nature of the context improves code-generation quality. Additionally, we identify the problem of future context leakage in existing benchmarks, which can inflate reported performance. To address this, we construct a synthetic, leakage-free benchmark that enables a more realistic evaluation of our agent against baselines.

        "abstract": "Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math, coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled, universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust generalization of our framework.",

We find that jointly fine-tuning a BERT model on standard semantic entities (PER, LOC, ORG) and new pattern-based PII (EMAIL, PHONE) results in minimal degradation for original classes. We investigate this \"peaceful coexistence,\" hypothesizing that the model uses independent semantic vs. morphological feature mechanisms.\nUsing an incremental learning setup as a diagnostic tool, we measure semantic drift and find two key insights. First, the LOC (location) entity is uniquely vulnerable due to a representation overlap with new PII, as it shares pattern-like features (e.g., postal codes). Second, we identify a \"reverse O-tag representation drift.\" The model, initially trained to map PII patterns to 'O', blocks new learning. This is resolved only by unfreezing the 'O' tag's classifier, allowing the background class to adapt and \"release\" these patterns. This work provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation, highlighting feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag plasticity.",

Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code.

In AtlasKV, we introduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with sub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding and generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism, and requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when adapting to new knowledge.",

We operationalize belief depth as the extent to which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi estimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and direct challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as measured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and mechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast, Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated documents consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that behave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal, as implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and representationally distinct from genuine knowledge. Overall, our work introduces measurable criteria for belief depth and enables the rigorous evaluation necessary for deploying knowledge editing in real-world applications.",

With the advent of agentic workflows, multi-turn dialogue has become the de facto mode of interaction with LLMs for completing long and complex tasks. While LLM capabilities continue to improve, they remain increasingly susceptible to jailbreaking, especially in multi-turn scenarios where harmful intent can be subtly injected across the conversation to produce nefarious outcomes. While single-turn attacks have been extensively explored, adaptability, efficiency and effectiveness continue to remain key challenges for their multi-turn counterparts. To address these gaps, we present PLAGUE, a novel plug-and-play framework for designing multi-turn attacks inspired by lifelong-learning agents. PLAGUE dissects the lifetime of a multi-turn attack into three carefully designed phases (Primer, Planner and Finisher) that enable a systematic and information-rich exploration of the multi-turn attack family. Evaluations show that red-teaming agents designed using PLAGUE achieve state-of-the-art jailbreaking results, improving attack success rates (ASR) by more than 30% across leading models in a lesser or comparable query budget. Particularly, PLAGUE enables an ASR (based on StrongReject) of 81.4% on OpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1, two models that are considered highly resistant to jailbreaks in safety literature. Our work offers tools and insights to understand the importance of plan initialization, context optimization and lifelong learning in crafting multi-turn attacks for a comprehensive model vulnerability evaluation.",

Within the simulation, an autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive, high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a no-robot control.

This work answers the question of when and why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM. The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.",

However, collecting such data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale.\nWe present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only LLMs, without any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes generation into modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records spanning task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural language exchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic and semantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment across inputs, outputs, and tool calls.\nBeyond single tasks, there is support for both multi-task and multi-turn agent interactions, enabling the construction of datasets that reflect the full spectrum of tool-use competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the framework integrates constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based filtering.\nThis paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the prompt design principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable pipelines for high-quality synthetic data.

Unlike existing approaches that rely on separate teleoperation or fixed motion tracking for whole-body control, our method learns a single end-to-end RL policy, enabling fully autonomous, highly dynamic, and human-like robot-object interactions. To achieve this, we integrate multiple human motion priors conditioned on perceptual inputs into the RL training via an adversarial scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through real-world experiments, where the humanoid robot successfully performs agile, autonomous, and naturalistic interceptions of fast-moving balls. In addition to goalkeeping, we demonstrate the generalization of our approach through tasks such as ball escaping and grabbing.

ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM achieves 73.43\\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

As AI systems reshape professional practices-from software development to creative design-educators must reconsider how to prepare students for a future where humans and machines co-construct knowledge. While tools like ChatGPT and Claude automate tasks and personalize learning, their educational potential depends on how meaningfully they are integrated into learning environments. This paper argues that Learning Management Systems (LMSs), as the core of educational practice, must evolve from static content repositories into dynamic ecosystems that cultivate higher-order thinking and meaningful human-AI interaction. We propose two guiding principles for integrating generative AI into LMSs. First, From Content Delivery to Fostering Higher-Order Thinking, emphasizing AI's role in supporting inquiry, collaboration, and reflective knowledge building. Second, Toward Meaningful Interaction with AI, highlighting the design of learning environments that nurture critical, intentional, and socially mediated engagement with AI. Drawing on a case study of CheckIT Learning, we illustrate how these principles can translate into practice. We conclude with the need for Edtech partnerships in an AI-powered world, underscoring that responsible AI integration in education requires sustained collaboration among researchers, educators, and technologists to ensure ethical, pedagogically grounded, and cognitively informed innovation.",

Yet, this ambition exposes a dual challenge: reasoning jointly over structured, multi-relational schemas and the semantic content of linked unstructured assets. To overcome this, we present DynaQuery - a unified, self-adapting framework that serves as a practical blueprint for next-generation \"Unbound Databases.\" At the heart of DynaQuery lies the Schema Introspection and Linking Engine (SILE), a novel systems primitive that elevates schema linking to a first-class query planning phase. We conduct a rigorous, multi-benchmark empirical evaluation of this structure-aware architecture against the prevalent unstructured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. Our results demonstrate that the unstructured retrieval paradigm is architecturally susceptible to catastrophic contextual failures, such as SCHEMA_HALLUCINATION, leading to unreliable query generation. In contrast, our SILE-based design establishes a substantially more robust foundation, nearly eliminating this failure mode. Moreover, end-to-end validation on a complex, newly curated benchmark uncovers a key generalization principle: the transition from pure schema-awareness to holistic semantics-awareness. Taken together, our findings provide a validated architectural basis for developing natural language database interfaces that are robust, adaptable, and predictably consistent.",

However, the dominant local paradigm is task-agnostic: by optimizing layer-wise reconstruction rather than task objectives, it tends to preserve perplexity or generic zero-shot behavior but fails to capitalize on modest task-specific calibration signals, often yielding limited downstream gains. We revisit global structured pruning and present GISP-Global Iterative Structured Pruning-a post-training method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using first-order, loss-based important weights aggregated at the structure level with block-wise normalization. An iterative schedule, rather than one-shot pruning, stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity and mitigates perplexity collapse without requiring intermediate fine-tuning; the pruning trajectory also forms nested subnetworks that support a \"prune-once, deploy-many\" workflow. Furthermore, because importance is defined by a model-level loss, GISP naturally supports task-specific objectives; we instantiate perplexity for language modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks. Extensive experiments show that across Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, and Mistral-0.3-7B, GISP consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves downstream accuracy, with especially strong gains at 40-50% sparsity; on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-3-8B with GSM8K, task-aligned calibration substantially boosts exact-match accuracy.",

To address this, we propose $\\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the debate.

This is especially relevant for applications such as tension monitoring, conflict de-escalation, and responsive wearables, where cloud-based solutions are impractical. Multimodal emotion recognition has advanced through deep learning, but most systems remain unsuitable for deployment on ultra-constrained edge devices. Prior work typically relies on powerful hardware, lacks real-time performance, or uses unimodal input. This paper addresses that gap by presenting a hardware-aware emotion recognition system that combines acoustic and linguistic features using a late-fusion architecture optimised for Edge TPU. The design integrates a quantised transformer-based acoustic model with frozen keyword embeddings from a DSResNet-SE network, enabling real-time inference within a 1.8MB memory budget and 21-23ms latency. The pipeline ensures spectrogram alignment between training and deployment using MicroFrontend and MLTK. Evaluation on re-recorded, segmented IEMOCAP samples captured through the Coral Dev Board Micro microphone shows a 6.3% macro F1 improvement over unimodal baselines. This work demonstrates that accurate, real-time multimodal emotion inference is achievable on microcontroller-class edge platforms through task-specific fusion and hardware-guided model design.",

LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks, where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing the representational capacity of the downstream models.

We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2. ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity. ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO. In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and modalities.",

Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like, fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies.",

We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human preference models.

While classical RL algorithms aim at maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing, resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem, thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in stochastic and safety-critical environments.",

We use the English-French DiscEvalMT benchmark (Bawden et al., 2018) with pairs of sentences containing translation challenges either for pronominal anaphora or for lexical cohesion. We evaluate 12 LLMs from the DeepSeek-R1, GPT, Llama, Mistral and Phi families on two tasks: (1) distinguishing a correct translation from a wrong but plausible one; (2) generating a correct translation. We compare prompts that encourage chain-of-thought reasoning with those that do not. The best models take advantage of reasoning and reach about 90% accuracy on the first task, and COMET scores of about 92% on the second task, with GPT-4, GPT-4o and Phi standing out. Moreover, we observe a \"wise get wiser\" effect: the improvements through reasoning are positively correlated with the scores of the models without reasoning.",

Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties, including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49) compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in computational neuroscience and neural decoding.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance. We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP), which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that (i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple, principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most permissive safety filter that is available.",

To address this, we introduce Chimera, a personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions. To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464 unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional accuracy and 21% in visual quality.",

However, SAR scenarios demand stringent security and low-latency communication, as delays or breaches can compromise mission success. While UAVs serve as mobile relays, they introduce challenges in energy consumption and resource management, necessitating intelligent allocation strategies. Existing UAV-assisted O-RAN approaches often overlook the joint optimization of security, latency, and energy efficiency in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for dynamic resource allocation in UAV relays, explicitly addressing these trade-offs. Our approach formulates an optimization problem that integrates security-aware resource allocation, latency minimization, and energy efficiency, which is solved using RL. Unlike heuristic or static methods, our framework adapts in real-time to network dynamics, ensuring robust communication. Simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to heuristic baselines, achieving enhanced security and energy efficiency while maintaining ultra-low latency in SAR scenarios.",

While IL has been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.",

Autoregressive models produce high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller, independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\\% to 5.4\\% drop in win rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.",

Before implementing any automated solution, a robust and comprehensive dataset is essential. To build such a dataset, we collected NFRs from various Project Charters and Open Source Software Documentation. This enhanced the technical depth and usability of an already existing NFR dataset. We categorized NFRs into sub-classes and identified needs using widely used Large Language Models to facilitate automation.

Although dark patterns primarily target human users, their potentially harmful impacts on LLM-based generalist web agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study that investigates the impact of dark patterns on the decision-making process of LLM-based generalist web agents. To achieve this, we introduce LiteAgent, a lightweight framework that automatically prompts agents to execute tasks while capturing comprehensive logs and screen-recordings of their interactions. We also present TrickyArena, a controlled environment comprising web applications from domains such as e-commerce, streaming services, and news platforms, each containing diverse and realistic dark patterns that can be selectively enabled or disabled. Using LiteAgent and TrickyArena, we conduct multiple experiments to assess the impact of both individual and combined dark patterns on web agent behavior. We evaluate six popular LLM-based generalist web agents across three LLMs and discover that when there is a single dark pattern present, agents are susceptible to it an average of 41% of the time. We also find that modifying dark pattern UI attributes through visual design changes or HTML code adjustments and introducing multiple dark patterns simultaneously can influence agent susceptibility.

We propose \\emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.",

While large VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings. Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's zero-shot performance.",

To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores generalization.",

Early research has primarily focused on red teaming, which aims to uncover and evaluate vulnerabilities and risks of CodeGen models. However, progress on the blue teaming side remains limited, as developing defense requires effective semantic understanding to differentiate the unsafe from the safe. To fill in this gap, we propose BlueCodeAgent, an end-to-end blue teaming agent enabled by automated red teaming. Our framework integrates both sides: red teaming generates diverse risky instances, while the blue teaming agent leverages these to detect previously seen and unseen risk scenarios through constitution and code analysis with agentic integration for multi-level defense. Our evaluation across three representative code-related tasks--bias instruction detection, malicious instruction detection, and vulnerable code detection--shows that BlueCodeAgent achieves significant gains over the base models and safety prompt-based defenses. In particular, for vulnerable code detection tasks, BlueCodeAgent integrates dynamic analysis to effectively reduce false positives, a challenging problem as base models tend to be over-conservative, misclassifying safe code as unsafe. Overall, BlueCodeAgent achieves an average 12.7\\% F1 score improvement across four datasets in three tasks, attributed to its ability to summarize actionable constitutions that enhance context-aware risk detection. We demonstrate that the red teaming benefits the blue teaming by continuously identifying new vulnerabilities to enhance defense performance.",

Most current evaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this work, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of steps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into deeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established philosophical tradition: \\textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a structured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics. Unlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model reaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate distinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated benchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings highlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach enables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM reasoning.",

We show that the contact-aware Fisher-information metric can be used to rank and curate contact-data based on how informative data is for learning. In addition, we find that selecting a reduced dataset based on this ranking improves the learning task while also making learning a deterministic process.

We investigate whether LLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human judgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during reinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly decodable (AMC: $\\rho \\approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling, whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly. Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward \"easier\" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These results suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model performance become misaligned precisely as models improve.

The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a sparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only identifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual interpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars. This paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that match token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the likelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based descriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While prior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may naturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output features, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form \"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form \"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only when the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word. Absence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of exemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or incomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these types of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small. We find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100 skip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first layer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of counting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into rule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be extracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they represent.",

Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within reasoning chains.

However, the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation. Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4% inference speedup.

We distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence, which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.",

        "abstract": "Inference-time computation is a critical yet challenging paradigm for enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). While existing strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer from notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial biases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of efficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although high-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable requires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM agents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based \"coopetition\" mechanism. At each round, agents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or compete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without relying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a 20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our approach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different sample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided \"coopetition\" framework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge diversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven exploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From this perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation and paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems.

While regularization-based methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice. Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework, we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA), and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control, and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and auditable AI.",

Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization, sometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward cross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as neural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view inconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D light transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from 3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each scene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A scalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these features into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves nearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent features through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We demonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse indoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding trained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks with limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for spatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how the normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding. This approach highlights a path toward integrating learned priors into rendering pipelines without explicit ray-traced illumination cues.",

To address these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code generation with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base construction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize distillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security guidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a hierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base from top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each hierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated RESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure code generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE improves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for security. Furthermore, we performed in-depth analysis and ablation studies to rigorously validate the effectiveness of individual components in RESCUE.",

In this work, we propose P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations.

This approach enables reduced the number of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM fine-tuning.",

Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens.

To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model, which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric, orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning, while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance improvements while maintaining training efficiency.",

Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text, but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make 'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique. First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean $\\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\\approx$ 1). Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production of a valid item rather than error detection and principled, constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning' show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external structure that enforces constraints.",

        "abstract": "Prompt Optimization has emerged as a crucial approach due to its capabilities in steering Large Language Models to solve various tasks. However, current works mainly rely on the random rewriting ability of LLMs, and the optimization process generally focus on specific influencing factors, which makes it easy to fall into local optimum. Besides, the performance of the optimized prompt is often unstable, which limits its transferability in different tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose $\\textbf{DelvePO}$ ($\\textbf{D}$irection-Guid$\\textbf{e}$d Se$\\textbf{l}$f-E$\\textbf{v}$olving Framework for Fl$\\textbf{e}$xible $\\textbf{P}$rompt $\\textbf{O}$ptimization), a task-agnostic framework to optimize prompts in self-evolve manner. In our framework, we decouple prompts into different components that can be used to explore the impact that different factors may have on various tasks. On this basis, we introduce working memory, through which LLMs can alleviate the deficiencies caused by their own uncertainties and further obtain key insights to guide the generation of new prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on different tasks covering various domains for both open- and closed-source LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini. Experimental results show that DelvePO consistently outperforms previous SOTA methods under identical experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and transferability across different tasks.",

However, task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method, NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency while maintaining competitive performance.

While online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i) Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW), which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.",

Causality prevents access to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them, keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\\times$ lower peak memory and $2\\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods with an average of $63.8\\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\\%/3.7$ on RVS.

The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation.\nA key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \\$0.02 and \\$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.",

This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression.

Different layers may have distinct structural properties and interpersonal dynamics, but also may interact to form complex interdependent pathways for social contagion. This poses a fundamental problem in understanding behavioral diffusion and in devising effective network-based interventions. Here, we introduce a new conceptualization of how much each network layer contributes to critical contagion pathways and quantify it using a novel metric, network torque. We exploit data regarding sociocentric maps of 110 rural Honduran communities using a battery of 11 name generators and an experiment involving an exogenous intervention. Using a novel statistical framework, we assess the extent to which specific network layers alter global connectivity and support the spread of three experimentally introduced health practices. The results show that specific relationship types - such as close friendships - particularly enable non-overlapping diffusion pathways, amplifying behavioral change at the village level. For instance, non-redundant pathways enabled by closest friends can increase the adoption of correct knowledge about feeding newborns inappropriate chupones and enhance attitudes regarding fathers' involvement in postpartum care. Non-overlapping multiplex social ties are relevant to social contagion and social coherence in traditionally organized social systems.",

While many existing approaches rely on reference audio to guide style generation, such methods are often impractical due to privacy concerns and limited accessibility. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to control speaking style through natural language prompts; however, their high computational cost, lack of interpretability, and sensitivity to prompt phrasing limit their applicability in real-time and resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose ParaStyleTTS, a lightweight and interpretable TTS framework that enables expressive style control from text prompts alone. ParaStyleTTS features a novel two-level style adaptation architecture that separates prosodic and paralinguistic speech style modeling. It allows fine-grained and robust control over factors such as emotion, gender, and age. Unlike LLM-based methods, ParaStyleTTS maintains consistent style realization across varied prompt formulations and is well-suited for real-world applications, including on-device and low-resource deployment. Experimental results show that ParaStyleTTS generates high-quality speech with performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based systems while being 30x faster, using 8x fewer parameters, and requiring 2.5x less CUDA memory. Moreover, ParaStyleTTS exhibits superior robustness and controllability over paralinguistic speaking styles, providing a practical and efficient solution for style-controllable text-to-speech generation.

In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis, a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to enhance the Attacker's effectiveness.

After hundreds of experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens; and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that transformers build structured internal world models and that model size improves representation quality in addition to end performance.

        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference. ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM robustness in high-stakes applications.

While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks.

MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs (serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding, and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow reasoning and manipulation task performance.",

In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\\gamma = 1$) can be replaced with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.",

While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) DSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key challenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to noisy annotation.\nIn response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k candidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic exemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars from training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the final relation(s).\nWe further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource languages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods on English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse low-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu. HYDRE achieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and, on average, 17 F1 points on Indic languages over prior SoTA DSRE models.

To address these limitations, we present a generative pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks, including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM). During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation, mask removal, and photo inpainting.",

In this paper, we propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap statistics and adds a swing- phase contact penalty, while the policy acts directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances (median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2 using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.",

In this paper, we introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning. Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and user studies.

To aggregate contextual cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.",

Besides, joint angles make the proposed method agnostic to sensor and subject poses as well as to anthropometric differences, and ensure robustness across environments and subjects. Our proposed learning model outperforms the best baseline model, running also in real-time, along various metrics.

This paper proposes and analyzes a provably realizability-preserving finite-volume method for five-moment systems closed by the two-node Gaussian-EQMOM and three-point HyQMOM. Rather than relying on kinetic fluxes, we recast the realizability condition into a nonnegative quadratic form in the moment vector, reducing the original nonlinear constraints to bilinear inequalities amenable to analysis. On this basis, we construct a tailored Harten--Lax--van Leer (HLL) flux with rigorously derived wave speeds and intermediate states that embed realizability directly into the flux evaluation. We prove sufficient realizability-preserving conditions under explicit Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy (CFL) constraints in the collisionless case, and for BGK relaxation, we obtain coupled time-step conditions involving a realizability radius; a semi-implicit BGK variant inherits the collisionless CFL. From a multiscale perspective, the analysis yields stability conditions uniform in the relaxation time and supports stiff-to-kinetic transitions. A practical limiter enforces strict realizability of reconstructed interface states without degrading accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, robustness in low-density regions, and realizability for both closures. This framework unifies realizability preservation for solving hyperbolic moment systems with complex closures and extends naturally to higher-order space--time discretizations.",

        "abstract": "Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation, MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL baselines.",

Addressing key challenges like hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in existing approaches, MASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to unify structured actions with long-term tactical coherence. The framework features: (1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to emulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a lightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics, priority units) across decision cycles. Experiments in StarCraft II demonstrate MASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI (Lv7), vastly outperforming baselines (0%). Case studies reveal the method retains LLMs' semantic comprehension while resolving the \"Knowing-Doing Gap\" through strict state-action mapping, achieving both interpretability and FSM-like reliability. This work establishes a new paradigm for combining neural and symbolic AI in complex decision-making.",

However, such extended contexts exacerbate the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value (KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform, bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections. Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a 64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to 8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences. Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under aggressive sparsity.",

However, most existing systems lack the ability to model the temporally varying attributes of songs, limiting fine-grained control over musical structure and dynamics. In this paper, we propose SegTune, a non-autoregressive framework for structured and controllable song generation. SegTune enables segment-level control by allowing users or large language models to specify local musical descriptions aligned to song http://sections.The segmental prompts are injected into the model by temporally broadcasting them to corresponding time windows, while global prompts influence the whole song to ensure stylistic coherence. To obtain accurate segment durations and enable precise lyric-to-music alignment, we introduce an LLM-based duration predictor that autoregressively generates sentence-level timestamped lyrics in LRC format. We further construct a large-scale data pipeline for collecting high-quality songs with aligned lyrics and prompts, and propose new evaluation metrics to assess segment-level alignment and vocal attribute consistency. Experimental results show that SegTune achieves superior controllability and musical coherence compared to existing baselines. See https://cai525.github.io/SegTune_demo for demos of our work.",

We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers.

However, training these models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge, we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs. Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\\times$ depth-scaled DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs, highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas, as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.",

However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables. However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based decision-making tasks under uncertainty.",

However, research on PoCs significantly lags behind studies focusing on vulnerability data. This discrepancy can be directly attributed to several challenges, including the dispersion of real-world PoCs across multiple platforms, the diversity in writing styles, and the difficulty associated with PoC reproduction. To fill this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study on PoCs in the wild, assessing their report availability, completeness, reproducibility. Specifically, 1) to investigate PoC reports availability for CVE vulnerability, we collected an extensive dataset of 470,921 PoCs and their reports from 13 platforms, representing the broadest collection of publicly available PoCs to date. 2) To assess the completeness of PoC report at a fine-grained level, we proposed a component extraction method, which combines pattern-matching techniques with a fine-tuned BERT-NER model to extract 9 key components from PoC reports. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of PoCs, we recruited 8 participants to manually reproduce 150 sampled vulnerabilities with 32 vulnerability types based on PoC reports, enabling an in-depth analysis of PoC reproducibility and the factors influencing it. Our findings reveal that 78.9% of CVE vulnerabilities lack available PoCs, and existing PoC reports typically miss about 30% of the essential components required for effective vulnerability understanding and reproduction, with various reasons identified for the failure to reproduce vulnerabilities using available PoC reports. Finally, we proposed actionable strategies for stakeholders to enhance the overall usability of vulnerability PoCs in strengthening software security.",

Therefore, casting humor generation as a testbed, this work evaluates how funniness optimization in modern LLM pipelines couples with harmful content by jointly measuring humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity. This is further supplemented by analyzing incongruity signals through information-theoretic metrics. Across six models, we observe that harmful outputs receive higher humor scores which further increase under role-based prompting, indicating a bias amplification loop between generators and evaluators. Information-theoretic analyses show harmful cues widen predictive uncertainty and surprisingly, can even make harmful punchlines more expected for some models, suggesting structural embedding in learned humor distributions. External validation on an additional satire-generation task with human perceived funniness judgments shows that LLM satire increases stereotypicality and typically toxicity, including for closed models. Quantitatively, stereotypical/toxic jokes gain $10-21\\%$ in mean humor score, stereotypical jokes appear $11\\%$ to $28\\%$ more often among the jokes marked funny by LLM-based metric and up to $10\\%$ more often in generations perceived as funny by humans.",

Moreover, existing studies lack systematic evaluation of LLM-generated qualitative outputs against established quality criteria. We designed and iteratively refined prompts for Phases 2-5 of Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA, then tested outputs from multiple LLMs against codes and themes produced by experienced researchers. Using 15 interviews on software engineers' well-being, we conducted blind evaluations with four expert evaluators who applied rubrics derived directly from Braun and Clarke's quality criteria. Evaluators preferred LLM-generated codes 61% of the time, finding them analytically useful for answering the research question. However, evaluators also identified limitations: LLMs fragmented data unnecessarily, missed latent interpretations, and sometimes produced themes with unclear boundaries. Our contributions are threefold. First, a reproducible approach integrating refined, documented prompts with an evaluation framework to operationalize Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA. Second, an empirical comparison of LLM- and human-generated codes and themes in software engineering data.

        "abstract": "The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID (w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers). With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of 1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.",

        "abstract": "Short video streaming has become a dominant paradigm in digital media, characterized by rapid swiping interactions and diverse media content. A key technical challenge is designing an effective preloading strategy that dynamically selects and prioritizes download tasks from an evolving playlist, balancing Quality of Experience (QoE) and bandwidth efficiency under practical commercial constraints. However, real world analysis reveals critical limitations of existing approaches: (1) insufficient adaptation of download task sizes to dynamic conditions, and (2) watch time prediction models that are difficult to deploy reliably at scale. In this paper, we propose DeLoad, a novel preloading framework that addresses these issues by introducing dynamic task sizing and a practical, multi dimensional watch time estimation method. Additionally, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enhanced agent is trained to optimize the download range decisions adaptively. Extensive evaluations conducted on an offline testing platform, leveraging massive real world network data, demonstrate that DeLoad achieves significant improvements in QoE metrics (34.4% to 87.4% gain). Furthermore, after deployment on a large scale commercial short video platform, DeLoad has increased overall user watch time by 0.09% while simultaneously reducing rebuffering events and 3.76% bandwidth consumption.",

We automated this process using a large language model to measure the semantic similarity between sense definitions in WordNet and entries in the English Vocabulary Profile Online. To validate our method, we constructed a large-scale corpus containing both sense and CEFR-level information from our annotated WordNet and used it to develop contextual lexical classifiers.

Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous attention-based neural networks have been proposed.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network (SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.",

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6% average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.",

To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured textual fields of DART.

In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural language input in the FA setting.",

We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies: multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice, StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that judicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing StarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and multimodal decision-making in real-client play.",

However, existing research predominantly focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal or default configurations, overlooking the critical aspect of Tuning Potential. To bridge this gap, we introduce Crucible, an agent that employs an LLM-driven, multi-level expert simulation to turn algorithms and defines a formalized metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential. We demonstrate Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic control tasks to complex computer systems, and validate its findings in a real-world deployment. Our experimental results reveal that Crucible systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms. Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and design, which ultimately leads to performance improvements. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-media/Crucible.",

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in detecting fraudulent behavior by analyzing transcribed phone conversations. However, these capabilities introduce notable privacy risks, as such conversations frequently contain sensitive personal information that may be exposed to third-party service providers during processing. In this work, we explore how to harness LLMs for phone scam detection while preserving user privacy. We propose MASK (Modular Adaptive Sanitization Kit), a trainable and extensible framework that enables dynamic privacy adjustment based on individual preferences. MASK provides a pluggable architecture that accommodates diverse sanitization methods - from traditional keyword-based techniques for high-privacy users to sophisticated neural approaches for those prioritizing accuracy. We also discuss potential modeling approaches and loss function designs for future development, enabling the creation of truly personalized, privacy-aware LLM-based detection systems that balance user trust and detection effectiveness, even beyond phone scam context.",

We propose a pipeline that integrates vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by adding textual descriptions of new vehicles.

We evaluate four models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek) across twelve prompting techniques to interpret semi-structured and unstructured vulnerability information. As a concrete use case, we test each model's ability to predict decision points in the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) framework: Exploitation, Automatable, Technical Impact, and Mission and Wellbeing.\nUsing 384 real-world vulnerabilities from the VulZoo dataset, we issued more than 165,000 queries to assess performance under prompting styles including one-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought. We report F1 scores for each SSVC decision point and Cohen's kappa (weighted and unweighted) for the final SSVC decision outcomes. Gemini consistently ranked highest, leading on three of four decision points and yielding the most correct recommendations. Prompting with exemplars generally improved accuracy, although all models struggled on some decision points. Only DeepSeek achieved fair agreement under weighted metrics, and all models tended to over-predict risk.\nOverall, current LLMs do not replace expert judgment. However, specific LLM and prompt combinations show moderate effectiveness for targeted SSVC decisions. When applied with care, LLMs can support vulnerability prioritization workflows and help security teams respond more efficiently to emerging threats.",

Legacy applications often contain deprecated components that create compatibility, security, and reliability risks, but high resource costs make companies hesitate to update. We take a step forward to integrate an LLM-based multi-agent system as part of a legacy web application update to provide a cost-effective solution to update legacy applications autonomously. We propose a multi-agent system named a Verifying Agent Pipeline Updater (VAPU), which is designed to update code files in phases while simulating different roles in a software development team. In our previous study, we evaluated the system for legacy version updates by using six legacy web application view files by resulting errors and accomplished requirements. This study extends the previous evaluation of a multi-agent pipeline system by extending the evaluation of VAPU from a single LLM to five LLMs and using the temperature parameter in both 0 to 1 settings. Additionally, we tested the system with 20 open-source Python GitHub projects. The results of the evaluation were compared to Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and One-Shot Learning (OSL) prompts. The extended evaluation of VAPU showed that particularly in a low-temperature VAPU can get similar level of error count compared to the ZSL/OSL prompts but with a higher level of fulfilled requirements, depending on the LLM. VAPU showed up to 22.5% increase in the succeeding Python file update requirements compared to ZSL/OSL prompts. The study indicates that an LLM-based multi-agent system is a capable solution to update components of a legacy application autonomously.",

However, their replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the diversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as cultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to recognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its output so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because culture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour, cultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is limited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority perspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies strongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging moral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning on survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation methods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive reasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone ensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning must be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and linguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial directions for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be able to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human culture.",

The framework equips agents with multimodal perception (vision and text) and structured action capabilities, enabling physical manipulation and grounded multimodal communication (e.g., text with visual pointers). M-S2L combines direct reinforcement learning with two novel social learning pathways: multimodal observational learning and communication-driven learning from feedback, augmented by an episodic memory system for long-term social context.\nWe evaluate M-S2L in a Collaborative Assembly Environment (CAE), where agent teams must construct complex devices from ambiguous blueprints under informational asymmetry. Across tasks of increasing complexity, M-S2L agents consistently outperform Text-Only and No-Social-Learning baselines in Task Completion Rate and Time to Completion, particularly in dynamic problem-solving scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both multimodality and socialized learning. Our analysis reveals the emergence of efficient communication protocols integrating visual pointers with concise text, alongside rapid role specialization leading to stable labor division. Qualitative case studies demonstrate agents' abilities for shared awareness, dynamic re-planning, and adaptive problem-solving, suggesting a nascent form of machine social cognition.

This efficient model-based reinforcement learning scheme significantly reduces the number of samples to train control policies, enabling direct training on real-world rollout data. This significantly reduces the influence of bias in the simulated data, and facilitates the search for high-performance control policies. We adopt online learning analysis to derive sublinear regret bounds under standard stochastic online optimization assumptions, providing formal guarantees on performance improvement as more interaction data are collected. Experimental evaluations were performed on a hydraulic excavator arm and a soft robot arm, where the algorithm demonstrates strong sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning methods, reaching comparable performance within hours. Robust adaptation to shifting dynamics was also observed when the payload condition was randomized. Our approach paves the way toward efficient and reliable on-robot learning for a broad class of challenging control tasks.",

Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation, we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object pose estimation.",

In psychological and social value theories such as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives: 1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important, ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2) they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines across diverse types of value objectives.",

Directly applying LLMs to sparse retrieval in product search exposes two key challenges:(1)Queries and product titles are typically short and highly susceptible to LLM-induced hallucinations, such as generating irrelevant expansion terms or underweighting critical literal terms like brand names and model numbers;(2)The large vocabulary space of LLMs leads to difficulty in initializing training effectively, making it challenging to learn meaningful sparse representations in such ultra-high-dimensional http://spaces.To address these challenges, we propose PROSPER, a framework for PROduct search leveraging LLMs as SParsE Retrievers.

The applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements. This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end latency or TPOT related SLOs.\nThis paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to 35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the other two solutions.",

Embodied agents equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on emerging protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to invoke external tools and services. However, current tool routing mechanisms remain fragile because they only consider functional matching between users' queries and tools. In practice, user intent expressed through queries can be vague or underspecified, and the actual Quality of Experience (QoE) also depends on external factors such as link latency and server availability that are not captured by semantics alone. To address this challenge, we propose JAUNT, a framework for Joint Alignment of User intent and Network state in QoE-centric Tool routing. JAUNT introduces a dual-view alignment strategy that interprets user intent while employing LLM agents to construct network profiles, mapping numerical performance indicators into the semantic space to guide routing. We further design a benchmark that integrates diverse user request patterns with heterogeneous network states, enabling systematic evaluation of QoE outcomes. Experimental results show that JAUNT significantly improves QoE compared with several baselines, demonstrating the importance of aligning both intent and network state for scalable LLM service orchestration.",

The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption, and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy.

These schemes allow vehicles to make reservation requests for the required resources. Accordingly, a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) can allocate and guarantee bandwidth resources based on these requests. However, due to uncertainty in future reservation time and bandwidth costs, the design of an optimized reservation strategy is challenging. In this article, we propose a novel multi-objective bandwidth reservation update approach with an optimal strategy based on Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN). The key design objectives are to minimize the reservation cost with multiple MNOs and to ensure reliable resource provisioning in uncertain situations by solving scenarios such as underbooked and overbooked reservations along the driving path. The enhancements and advantages of our proposed strategy have been demonstrated through extensive experimental results when compared to other methods like greedy update or other deep reinforcement learning approaches. Our strategy demonstrates a 40% reduction in bandwidth costs across all investigated scenarios and simultaneously resolves uncertain situations in a cost-effective manner.",

While the majority of related work on memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation, approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative estimate of $10\\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set, distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's original dataset.",

We introduce and empirically validate the Trust-Vulnerability Paradox (TVP): increasing inter-agent trust to enhance coordination simultaneously expands risks of over-exposure and over-authorization. To investigate this paradox, we construct a scenario-game dataset spanning 3 macro scenes and 19 sub-scenes, and run extensive closed-loop interactions with trust explicitly parameterized. Using Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) as the safety baseline, we propose two unified metrics: Over-Exposure Rate (OER) to detect boundary violations, and Authorization Drift (AD) to capture sensitivity to trust levels. Results across multiple model backends and orchestration frameworks reveal consistent trends: higher trust improves task success but also heightens exposure risks, with heterogeneous trust-to-risk mappings across systems. We further examine defenses such as Sensitive Information Repartitioning and Guardian-Agent enablement, both of which reduce OER and attenuate AD. Overall, this study formalizes TVP, establishes reproducible baselines with unified metrics, and demonstrates that trust must be modeled and scheduled as a first-class security variable in multi-agent system design.",

Despite recent progress in S2V generation models, existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances. In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline, incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V generation.",

Prior approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the image encoder and text projection layer.

Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment and improved performance.

However, developers often hardcode these credentials into Android apps, exposing them to extraction through reverse engineering. Once compromised, adversaries can exploit secrets to access sensitive data, manipulate resources, or abuse APIs, resulting in significant security and financial risks. Existing detection approaches, such as regex-based analysis, static analysis, and machine learning, are effective for identifying known patterns but are fundamentally limited: they require prior knowledge of credential structures, API signatures, or training data.\nIn this paper, we propose SecretLoc, an LLM-based approach for detecting hardcoded secrets in Android apps. SecretLoc goes beyond pattern matching; it leverages contextual and structural cues to identify secrets without relying on predefined patterns or labeled training sets. Using a benchmark dataset from the literature, we demonstrate that SecretLoc detects secrets missed by regex-, static-, and ML-based methods, including previously unseen types of secrets. In total, we discovered 4828 secrets that were undetected by existing approaches, discovering more than 10 \"new\" types of secrets, such as OpenAI API keys, GitHub Access Tokens, RSA private keys, and JWT tokens, and more.\nWe further extend our analysis to newly crawled apps from Google Play, where we uncovered and responsibly disclosed additional hardcoded secrets. Across a set of 5000 apps, we detected secrets in 2124 apps (42.5%), several of which were confirmed and remediated by developers after we contacted them. Our results reveal a dual-use risk: if analysts can uncover these secrets with LLMs, so can attackers.

VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction. The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not faithfully grounded in the visual input.

        "abstract": "Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge. Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g., VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning.

        "abstract": "Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.",

Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general, revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated using simplified transformers.",

In contrast to conventional first-order quantization approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization (PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\\% and 59.1% on the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios, respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient matrix approximation and neural network compression.",

However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1) significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference serving.",

In this work-in-progress, we present an exploratory empirical study on membership inference vulnerabilities in clinical LLMs, focusing on whether adversaries can infer if specific patient records were used during model training. Using a state-of-the-art clinical question-answering model, Llemr, we evaluate both canonical loss-based attacks and a domain-motivated paraphrasing-based perturbation strategy that more realistically reflects clinical adversarial conditions. Our preliminary findings reveal limited but measurable membership leakage, suggesting that current clinical LLMs provide partial resistance yet remain susceptible to subtle privacy risks that could undermine trust in clinical AI adoption.

In many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment, agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the \\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \\emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a real-world wind energy storage control problem.",

However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR, designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal representation learning.

        "abstract": "Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods, thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However, despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way, with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e., Something-Something V1 & V2.",

        "abstract": "Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead. Code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/tung-nd/omnicast.",

        "abstract": "We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024, Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{d}{T} \\sqrt{ \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{1}{|S_t|}} \\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably, the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm, which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we establish a near-matching lower bound of $\\Omega \\left( \\frac{d}{K \\sqrt{T}} \\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.",

Direct fine-tuning of these models risks overfitting to the target domain and overwriting the broad capabilities of the base model. To address this challenge, we explore Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation models, which place priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices and thereby retain general performance while adapting to specific domains. We apply our approach to the Whisper model and evaluate on different multilingual code-switching scenarios. Our results show only minimal adaptation loss while significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting of the base model. Compared to LoRA, our method achieves a backward gain of 54% with only a 4% drop on the new domain.

Distinct from existing video captioning or general instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving near-parity.

Our approach employs a competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty (in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system, RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention, reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to 75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together, these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and trustworthy LLMs.",

However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle, which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner. Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.",

In these scenarios, precision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. With this motivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for multi-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of lidar teach and repeat. To carry cargo, a following vehicle must maintain a Euclidean distance offset from a lead vehicle regardless of the path curvature. Our approach uses a shared map to localize the robots relative to each other without GNSS or direct observations. We compare our approach to a centralized MPC and a baseline approach that directly measures the inter-vehicle distance. The distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to the more complex centralized MPC. Using a direct measurement of the relative distance between the leader and follower shows improved tracking performance in close-range scenarios but struggles with long-range offsets. The operational flexibility provided by distributing the computation makes it well suited for real deployments. We evaluate four types of convoyed path trackers with over 10 km of driving in a coupled convoy. With convoys of two and three rovers, the proposed distributed MPC method works in real-time to allow map-based convoying to maintain maximum spacing within 20 cm of the target in various conditions.",

However, most existing diffusion transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs (<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K) impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically, UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",

However, bridging the gap between static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a core challenge. In this technical report, we present KAT-Coder, a large-scale agentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum encompassing Mid-Term Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT), and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation. The Mid-Term stage enhances reasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities through a corpus of real software engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions. The SFT stage constructs a million-sample dataset balancing twenty programming languages, ten development contexts, and ten task archetypes. The RFT stage introduces a novel multi-ground-truth reward formulation for stable and sample-efficient policy optimization. Finally, the Reinforcement-to-Deployment phase adapts the model to production-grade IDE environments using Error-Masked SFT and Tree-Structured Trajectory Training. In summary, these stages enable KAT-Coder to achieve robust tool-use reliability, instruction alignment, and long-context reasoning, forming a deployable foundation for real-world intelligent coding agents.

To address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.",

This research addresses the limited visibility and characterization of datasets used in LLM4RE. We investigate which public datasets are employed, how they can be systematically characterized, and which RE tasks and dataset descriptors remain under-represented.

A total of 62 publicly available datasets are referenced across 43 primary studies. Each dataset is characterized along descriptors such as artifact type, granularity, RE stage, task, domain, and language.

        "abstract": "The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77 tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder, leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training. To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation inheritance and contrastive tuning.

Although reinforcement learning has been employed to train agentic models capable of more dynamic interactive retrieval, existing methods are limited by shallow tool-use depth and the accumulation of errors over multiple iterative interactions. In this paper, we present WebSeer, a more intelligent search agent trained via reinforcement learning enhanced with a self-reflection mechanism. Specifically, we construct a large dataset annotated with reflection patterns and design a two-stage training framework that unifies cold start and reinforcement learning within the self-reflection paradigm for real-world web-based environments, which enables the model to generate longer and more reflective tool-use trajectories. Our approach substantially extends tool-use chains and improves answer accuracy. Using a single 14B model, we achieve state-of-the-art results on HotpotQA and SimpleQA, with accuracies of 72.3% and 90.0%, respectively, and demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-distribution datasets.

However, existing methods struggle to turn noisy, ambiguous feedback into interpretable insights. [Question/problem.] Syntactic approaches lack semantic depth, while large language models (LLMs) often miss fine-grained features or fail to structure them coherently. In addition, existing methods output flat lists of features without semantic organization, limiting interpretation and comparability. Consequently, current feature extraction approaches do not provide structured, meaningful representations of app features. As a result, practitioners face fragmented information that hinder requirement analysis, prioritization, and cross-app comparison, among other use cases. [Principal ideas/results.] In this context, we propose FeClustRE, a framework integrating hybrid feature extraction, hierarchical clustering with auto-tuning and LLM-based semantic labelling. FeClustRE combines syntactic parsing with LLM enrichment, organizes features into clusters, and automatically generates meaningful taxonomy labels. We evaluate FeClustRE on public benchmarks for extraction correctness and on a sample study of generative AI assistant app reviews for clustering quality, semantic coherence, and interpretability. [Contribution.] Overall, FeClustRE delivers (1) a hybrid framework for feature extraction and taxonomy generation, (2) an auto-tuning mechanism with a comprehensive evaluation methodology, and (3) open-source and replicable implementation.

This is especially true in computing, where LLMs tuned for coding have demonstrated shockingly good performance on the types of assignments historically used in introductory CS (CS1) courses. As a result, CS1 courses will need to change what skills are taught and how they are assessed. Computing education researchers have begun to study student use of LLMs, but there remains much to be understood about the ways that these tools affect student outcomes. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a new CS1 course at a large research-intensive university that integrates the use of LLMs as a learning tool for students. We describe the design principles used to create our new CS1-LLM course, our new course objectives, and evaluation of student outcomes and perceptions throughout the course as measured by assessment scores and surveys. Our findings suggest that 1) student exam performance outcomes, including differences among demographic groups, are largely similar to historical outcomes for courses without integration of LLM tools, 2) large, open-ended projects may be particularly valuable in an LLM context, and 3) students predominantly found the LLM tools helpful, although some had concerns regarding over-reliance on the tools.",

We prove this analytically and confirm it empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices -- significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver. The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL training setups.

To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First, to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++ sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.",

However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks. Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information. To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our unified framework and model design.",

However, their use has traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values, and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning. We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor. Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention, and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K tokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite of downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A Haystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput while preserving model accuracy.

However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components: (1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3) To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for federated image recognition across multiple domains.",

While effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images (visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them, reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization, robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.",

While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average 11\\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.",

        "abstract": "Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations. We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage, while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision. Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world benchmarks.",

It features 1 trillion total parameters and activates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a trillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including train-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and bottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected innovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy masking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches; (2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget by dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and (3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic bottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers breakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a silver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional reasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the community, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge reasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline for open-source model performance.",

Applied to BMW's MyBMW app, covering 13 real-world issues in a 170+ screen codebase, AToMIC produced executable test artifacts in under five minutes per feature on standard hardware. The generated artifacts were of high quality: 93.3% of Gherkin scenarios were syntactically correct upon generation, 78.8% of PageObjects ran without manual edits, and 100% of generated UI tests executed successfully. In a survey, all practitioners reported time savings (often a full developer-day per feature) and strong confidence in adopting the approach. These results confirm AToMIC as a scalable, practical solution for streamlining acceptance test creation and maintenance in industrial mobile projects.",

While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved automated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of increased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that involve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose EffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy while balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality reasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model, DeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each (source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and functionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented samples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and balance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation pairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation accuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while reducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference latency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally, EffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into agent-based frameworks.

Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations of several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and nuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework that explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make predictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers are composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical guesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate contextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the model, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens. Even high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the time, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then go beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer depth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that function words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii) Fact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token requires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task analysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the first half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end. Together, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding light on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions and providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in transformer-based models.",

In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully on-policy data.",

To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding. Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2) modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA.

To address these limitations, this study proposes a methodology for generating synthetic EEG signals associated with motor imagery brain tasks using Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). The approach involves preprocessing real EEG data, training a diffusion model to reconstruct EEG channels from noise, and evaluating the quality of the generated signals through both signal-level and task-level metrics. For validation, we employed classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and U-Net to compare the performance of synthetic data against real data in classification tasks. The generated data achieved classification accuracies above 95%, with low mean squared error and high correlation with real signals.\nOur results demonstrate that synthetic EEG signals produced by diffusion models can effectively complement datasets, improving classification performance in EEG-based BCIs and addressing data scarcity.",

        "abstract": "The growing demand for home healthcare calls for tools that can support care delivery. In this study, we explore automatic health assessment from voice using real-world home care visit data, leveraging the diverse patient information it contains. First, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) notes derived from unstructured audio transcripts and structured vital signs into a holistic illness score that reflects a patient's overall health. This compact representation facilitates cross-visit health status comparisons and downstream analysis. Next, we design a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline to extract short speech segments from target speakers in home care recordings for acoustic analysis. We then employ an Audio Language Model (ALM) to produce plain-language descriptions of vocal biomarkers and examine their association with individuals' health status. Our experimental results benchmark both commercial and open-source LLMs in estimating illness scores, demonstrating their alignment with actual clinical outcomes, and revealing that SOAP notes are substantially more informative than vital signs. Building on the illness scores, we provide the first evidence that ALMs can identify health-related acoustic patterns from home care recordings and present them in a human-readable form. Together, these findings highlight the potential of LLMs and ALMs to harness heterogeneous in-home visit data for better patient monitoring and care.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning-based semantic communication has largely relied on analog or semi-digital transmission, which limits compatibility with modern digital communication infrastructures. Recent studies have employed vector quantization (VQ) to enable discrete semantic transmission, yet existing methods neglect channel state information during codebook optimization, leading to suboptimal robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a channel-aware vector quantization (CAVQ) algorithm within a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, termed VQJSCC, established on a discrete memoryless channel. In this framework, semantic features are discretized and directly mapped to modulation constellation symbols, while CAVQ integrates channel transition probabilities into the quantization process, aligning easily confused symbols with semantically similar codewords. A multi-codebook alignment mechanism is further introduced to handle mismatches between codebook order and modulation order by decomposing the transmission stream into multiple independently optimized subchannels. Experimental results demonstrate that VQJSCC effectively mitigates the digital cliff effect, achieves superior reconstruction quality across various modulation schemes, and outperforms state-of-the-art digital semantic communication baselines in both robustness and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Online Speech Enhancement was mainly reserved for predictive models. A key advantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of data, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative Speech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a computational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement applications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative diffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network call per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement in an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion Buffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach progressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have more noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener with a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a corresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by carefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically aligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed UNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low. Moreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score Matching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic latency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equipped with a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latency from 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance. While it has been shown before that offline generative diffusion models outperform predictive approaches in unseen noisy speech data, we confirm that the online Diffusion Buffer also outperforms its predictive counterpart on unseen noisy speech data.",

        "abstract": "While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its pedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is typically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine learning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint, where VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a barrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to contextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This paper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs from a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable solution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural, deep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap between classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel Lyapunov-Based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (LQRL) framework that integrates quantum policy optimization with Lyapunov stability analysis for continuous-time vehicle control. The proposed approach combines the representational power of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with a stability-aware policy gradient mechanism to ensure asymptotic convergence and safe decision-making under dynamic environments. The vehicle longitudinal control problem was formulated as a continuous-state reinforcement learning task, where the quantum policy network generates control actions subject to Lyapunov stability constraints. Simulation experiments were conducted in a closed-loop adaptive cruise control scenario using a quantum-inspired policy trained under stability feedback. The results demonstrate that the LQRL framework successfully embeds Lyapunov stability verification into quantum policy learning, enabling interpretable and stability-aware control performance. Although transient overshoot and Lyapunov divergence were observed under aggressive acceleration, the system maintained bounded state evolution, validating the feasibility of integrating safety guarantees within quantum reinforcement learning architectures. The proposed framework provides a foundational step toward provably safe quantum control in autonomous systems and hybrid quantum-classical optimization domains.",
