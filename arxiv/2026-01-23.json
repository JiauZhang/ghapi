        "abstract": "Testing conversational AI systems at scale across diverse domains necessitates realistic and diverse user interactions capturing a wide array of behavioral patterns. We present a novel multi-agent framework for realistic, explainable human user simulation in interactive scenarios, using persona control and task state tracking to mirror human cognitive processes during goal-oriented conversations. Our system employs three specialized AI agents: (1) a User Agent to orchestrate the overall interaction, (2) a State Tracking Agent to maintain structured task state, and (3) a Message Attributes Generation Agent that controls conversational attributes based on task progress and assigned persona. To validate our approach, we implement and evaluate the framework for guest ordering at a restaurant with scenarios rich in task complexity, behavioral diversity, and conversational ambiguity. Through systematic ablations, we evaluate the contributory efficacy of each agentic component to overall simulation quality in terms of persona adherence, task completion accuracy, explainability, and realism. Our experiments demonstrate that the complete multi-agent system achieves superior simulation quality compared to single-LLM baselines, with significant gains across all evaluation metrics. This framework establishes a powerful environment for orchestrating agents to simulate human users with cognitive plausibility, decomposing the simulation into specialized sub-agents that reflect distinct aspects of human thought processes applicable across interactive domains.",

Although many artificial intelligence (AI)-based health applications have been developed for early detection, most function as \"black boxes,\" lacking transparency in their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer a solution, yet their technical outputs are often incomprehensible to non-expert users. This research aims to develop a mobile application front-end that presents XAI-driven diabetes risk analysis in an intuitive, understandable format. Development followed the waterfall methodology, comprising requirements analysis, interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Based on user preference surveys, the application adopts two primary visualization types - bar charts and pie charts - to convey the contribution of each risk factor. These are complemented by personalized textual narratives generated via integration with GPT-4o. The application was developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The resulting prototype interprets SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a key XAI approach, into accessible graphical visualizations and narratives. Evaluation through user comprehension testing (Likert scale and interviews) and technical functionality testing confirmed the research objectives were met. The combination of visualization and textual narrative effectively enhanced user understanding (average score 4.31/5) and empowered preventive action, supported by a 100% technical testing success rate.",

Participants assessed these systems across five dimensions: perceived understanding, social energy demands, information access/clarity, task difficulty, and data privacy concerns. The main findings of the study reveal that the physical robot was perceived as more understanding than the voice-only agent, with embodiment significantly shaping perceptions of sociability, animacy, and privacy.

The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision. This confirms AfriEconQA as a robust and challenging benchmark for the next generation of domain-specific IR and RAG systems. The AfriEconQA dataset and code will be made publicly available upon publication.",

However, traditional methods often only consider free-text responses and do not natively incorporate structured or categorical survey responses for topic modeling. And they produce abstract topics, requiring extensive human interpretation. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Agent LLM Topic Modeling Framework (MALTopic). This framework decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks executed by individual LLM agents: an enrichment agent leverages structured data to enhance textual responses, a topic modeling agent extracts latent themes, and a deduplication agent refines the results. Comparative analysis on a survey dataset demonstrates that MALTopic significantly improves topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to LDA and BERTopic. By integrating structured data and employing a multi-agent approach, MALTopic generates human-readable topics with enhanced contextual relevance, offering a more effective solution for analyzing complex survey data.",

This intelligence degradation-defined as over 30% drop in task performance-severely limits long-context applications. This degradation shows a common pattern: models maintain strong performance up to a critical threshold, then collapse catastrophically. We term this shallow long-context adaptation-models adapt for short to medium contexts but fail beyond critical thresholds. This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself. (2) Critical Threshold Determination: Through experiments on a mixed dataset (1,000 samples covering 5%-95% of context length), we identify the critical threshold for Qwen2.5-7B at 40-50% of maximum context length, where F1 scores drop from 0.55-0.56 to 0.3 (45.5% degradation), using five-method cross-validation. (3) Unified Framework: We consolidate shallow adaptation, explaining degradation patterns and providing a foundation for mitigation strategies. This work provides the first systematic characterization of intelligence degradation in open-source Qwen models, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in long-context scenarios.",

Generative AI (GenAI) presents a promising solution by enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction and automating content generation. Leveraging vision-language models and diffusion-based generation, GenAI can interpret ambiguous instructions, understand physical scenes, and generate or manipulate 3D content, significantly lowering barriers to XR adoption.

We introduce the Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB), a predictive caching mechanism that exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-millisecond retrieval latencies. Benchmarks demonstrate that Aeon achieves < 1ms retrieval latency on conversational workloads while ensuring state consistency via a zero-copy C++/Python bridge, effectively enabling persistent, structured memory for autonomous agents.",

We use behavior in two canonical economic games to study whether people have different expectations when decisions are made by LLMs acting on their behalf instead of themselves. More specifically, we study the social appropriateness of a spectrum of possible behaviors: when LLMs divide resources on our behalf (Dictator Game and Ultimatum Game) and when they monitor the fairness of splits of resources (Ultimatum Game). We use the Krupka-Weber norm elicitation task to detect shifts in social appropriateness ratings. Results of two pre-registered and incentivized experimental studies using representative samples from the UK and US (N = 2,658) show three key findings. First, people find that offers from machines - when no acceptance is necessary - are judged to be less appropriate than when they come from humans, although there is no shift in the modal response. Second - when acceptance is necessary - it is more appropriate for a person to reject offers from machines than from humans. Third, receiving a rejection of an offer from a machine is no less socially appropriate than receiving the same rejection from a human. Overall, these results suggest that people apply different norms for machines deciding on how to split resources but are not opposed to machines enforcing the norms. The findings are consistent with offers made by machines now being viewed as having both a cognitive and emotional component.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid evolution of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has driven a paradigm shift in multimodal fake news detection (MFND), transforming it from traditional feature-engineering approaches to unified, end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks. Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Contrary to the assumed reliability-capability trade-off, a positive Pearson correlation emerged (r = 0.45, p < 0.01, n = 51 at T=0.0) between determinism and faithfulness; models producing consistent outputs also tended to be more evidence-aligned.\nThree financial benchmarks are provided (compliance triage, portfolio constraints, DataOps exceptions; 50 cases each) along with an open-source stress-test harness.

To address this, we propose Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization (ICPO), a novel training framework that sensitizes the model to instruction ambiguity. ICPO augments the training corpus with underspecified prompts and conditions the reward signal on the user's illocutionary intent, rewarding the model for expressing uncertainty or asking for clarification when faced with ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that ICPO fosters appropriate humility, yielding a substantial average improvement of 75\\% in multi-turn conversation, while preserving robust performance on single-turn benchmarks.

While alignment and guardrails mitigate common misuse, they remain vulnerable to automated jailbreaking methods such as GCG, PEZ, and GBDA, which generate adversarial suffixes via training and gradient-based search. Although effective, these methods particularly GCG are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for organisations with constrained resources. This paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting approach that eliminates the need for retraining by matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts. A dataset of 1,000 prompts was classified into seven harm-related categories, and GCG, PEZ, and GBDA were evaluated on a Llama 3 8B model to identify the most effective attack method per category. Results reveal a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness. By retrieving semantically similar successful adversarial prompts, the proposed method achieves competitive attack success rates with significantly reduced computational cost. This work provides a practical framework for scalable red-teaming and security evaluation of aligned LLMs, including in settings where model internals are inaccessible.",

First, we find that models consistently deny being sentient: they attribute consciousness to humans but not to themselves. Second, classifiers trained to detect underlying beliefs - rather than mere outputs - provide no clear evidence that these denials are untruthful.

We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently provide lower quality answers to open-ended questions in low resource languages. We find that language significantly impacts the cultural context used by the model. This difference in context impacts the quality of the downstream answer.",

In this paper, we operationalize axial coding with large language models (LLMs). Extending an ensemble-based open coding approach with an LLM moderator, we add an axial coding step that groups open codes into higher-order categories, transforming raw debate transcripts into concise, hierarchical representations. We compare two strategies: (i) clustering embeddings of code-utterance pairs using density-based and partitioning algorithms followed by LLM labeling, and (ii) direct LLM-based grouping of codes and utterances into categories. We apply our method to Dutch parliamentary debates, converting lengthy transcripts into compact, hierarchically structured codes and categories. We evaluate our method using extrinsic metrics aligned with human-assigned topic labels (ROUGE-L, cosine, BERTScore), and intrinsic metrics describing code groups (coverage, brevity, coherence, novelty, JSD divergence). Our results reveal a trade-off: density-based clustering achieves high coverage and strong cluster alignment, while direct LLM grouping results in higher fine-grained alignment, but lower coverage 20%. Overall, clustering maximizes coverage and structural separation, whereas LLM grouping produces more concise, interpretable, and semantically aligned categories. To support future research, we publicly release the full dataset of utterances and codes, enabling reproducibility and comparative studies.",

However, most existing systems are designed for English-speaking users interacting via keyboards, which limits accessibility in multilingual and voice-first settings, particularly in regions like India. Voice-based interfaces offer a more inclusive modality, but spoken queries involving code present unique challenges due to the presence of non-standard English usage, domain-specific vocabulary, and custom identifiers such as variable and function names, often combined with code-mixed expressions. In this work, we develop a multilingual speech-driven framework for code understanding that accepts spoken queries in a user native language, transcribes them using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), applies code-aware ASR output refinement using Large Language Models (LLMs), and interfaces with code models to perform tasks such as code question answering and code retrieval through benchmarks such as CodeSearchNet, CoRNStack, and CodeQA. Focusing on four widely spoken Indic languages and English, we systematically characterize how transcription errors impact downstream task performance. We also identified key failure modes in ASR for code and demonstrated that LLM-guided refinement significantly improves performance across both transcription and code understanding stages. Our findings underscore the need for code-sensitive adaptations in speech interfaces and offer a practical solution for building robust, multilingual voice-driven programming tools.",

In this study, we explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically transform abusive words (vocal delivery) and lyrical content in popular music. Rather than simply muting or replacing a single word, our approach transforms the tone, intensity, and sentiment, thus not altering just the lyrics, but how it is expressed. We present a comparative analysis of four selected English songs and their transformed counterparts, evaluating changes through both acoustic and sentiment-based lenses. Our findings indicate that Gen-AI significantly reduces vocal aggressiveness, with acoustic analysis showing improvements in Harmonic to Noise Ratio, Cepstral Peak Prominence, and Shimmer. Sentiment analysis reduced aggression by 63.3-85.6\\% across artists, with major improvements in chorus sections (up to 88.6\\% reduction). The transformed versions maintained musical coherence while mitigating harmful content, offering a promising alternative to traditional content moderation that avoids triggering the \"forbidden fruit\" effect, where the censored content becomes more appealing simply because it is restricted. This approach demonstrates the potential for GenAI to create safer listening experiences while preserving artistic expression.",

They can easily lead to infinite loops or executions, exhaust resources, or introduce logical errors that degrade performance and compromise security. The problem are often undetected by traditional static analyzers because such tools rely on syntactic patterns, which makes them struggle to detect semantic flaws. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for vulnerability detection because of their ability to understand code contextually. Moreover, local LLMs unlike commercial ones like ChatGPT or Gemini addresses issues such as privacy, latency, and dependency concerns by facilitating efficient offline analysis. Consequently, this study proposes a prompt-based framework that utilize local LLMs for the detection of loop vulnerabilities within Python 3.7+ code. The framework targets three categories of loop-related issues, such as control and logic errors, security risks inside loops, and resource management inefficiencies. A generalized and structured prompt-based framework was designed and tested with two locally deployed LLMs (LLaMA 3.2; 3B and Phi 3.5; 4B) by guiding their behavior via iterative prompting. The designed prompt-based framework included key safeguarding features such as language-specific awareness, code-aware grounding, version sensitivity, and hallucination prevention. The LLM results were validated against a manually established baseline truth, and the results indicate that Phi outperforms LLaMA in precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings emphasize the importance of designing effective prompts for local LLMs to perform secure and accurate code vulnerability analysis.",

In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.\nFirst, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.",

Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.",

In this paper, we present FedUMM, a general federated learning framework for UMMs under non-IID multimodal data with low communication cost. Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training.

Beyond performance, KD is also explored as a privacy-preserving mechanism to mitigate the risk of training data leakage. While training data memorization has been extensively studied in standard pre-training and fine-tuning settings, its dynamics in a knowledge distillation setup remain poorly understood. In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation. Overall, we demonstrate that distillation can provide both improved generalization and reduced memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.",

Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit \"moral remorse\" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.",

We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve supervised alignment between latent representations and semantic concepts in diffusion models.",

From review sites to court documents, ``natural'' content has been contaminated by data points that appear similar to natural data, but are in fact LLM-generated. In this work we revisit fundamental learning theory questions in this, now ubiquitous, setting. We model this scenario as a sequence of learning tasks where the input is a mix of natural and synthetic data, and the learning algorithms are oblivious to the origin of any individual example.\nWe study the possibilities and limitations of ERM in this setting. For the problem of estimating the mean of an arbitrary $d$-dimensional distribution, we find that while ERM converges to the true mean, it is outperformed by an algorithm that assigns non-uniform weights to examples from different generations of data. For the PAC learning setting, the disparity is even more stark. We find that ERM does not always converge to the true concept, echoing the model collapse literature. However, we show there are algorithms capable of learning the correct hypothesis for arbitrary VC classes and arbitrary amounts of contamination.",

Panther engineers efficient, drop-in replacements for standard components including sketched linear layers, 2D convolution, multi-head attention, and randomized matrix decompositions (such as pivoted CholeskyQR). By implementing a custom C++/CUDA backend (pawX), Panther provides an optimized implementation that can run on both CPUs and GPUs.

Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning. Experiments on the collected and public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results with single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.",

Our benchmark, using 12 diverse datasets, evaluates two core skills: 1) \\textbf{Causal Detection} (identifying if a text contains a causal link) and 2) \\textbf{Causal Extraction} (pulling out the exact cause and effect phrases). We tested various prompting methods, from simple instructions (zero-shot) to more complex strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-shot In-Context Learning (FICL).\nThe results show major deficiencies in current models. The best model for detection, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, only achieved a mean score of 49.57\\% ($C_{detect}$), while the best for extraction, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, reached just 47.12\\% ($C_{extract}$). Models performed best on simple, explicit, single-sentence relations. However, performance plummeted for more difficult (and realistic) cases, such as implicit relationships, links spanning multiple sentences, and texts containing multiple causal pairs.

While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly diffusing into scientific practice, holding substantial promise while raising widespread concerns. Despite growing attention to AI use in scientific writing and evaluation, little is known about how the rise of LLMs is reshaping the public funding landscape. Here, we examine LLM involvement at key stages of the federal funding pipeline by combining two complementary data sources: confidential National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposal submissions from two large US R1 universities, including funded, unfunded, and pending proposals, and the full population of publicly released NSF and NIH awards. We find that LLM use rises sharply beginning in 2023 and exhibits a bimodal distribution, indicating a clear split between minimal and substantive use. Across both private submissions and public awards, higher LLM involvement is consistently associated with lower semantic distinctiveness, positioning projects closer to recently funded work within the same agency. The consequences of this shift are agency-dependent. LLM use is positively associated with proposal success and higher subsequent publication output at NIH, whereas no comparable associations are observed at NSF. Notably, the productivity gains at NIH are concentrated in non-hit papers rather than the most highly cited work. Together, these findings provide large-scale evidence that the rise of LLMs is reshaping how scientific ideas are positioned, selected, and translated into publicly funded research, with implications for portfolio governance, research diversity, and the long-run impact of science.",

Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 http://framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information.

Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation.

Researchers have proposed various bug-finding techniques for such libraries. Yet, there is much room for improvement. A key challenge in testing DL libraries is the lack of API specifications. Prior testing approaches often inaccurately model the input specifications of DL APIs, resulting in missed valid inputs that could reveal bugs or false alarms due to invalid inputs.\nTo address this challenge, we develop Centaur -- the first neurosymbolic technique to test DL library APIs using dynamically learned input constraints. Centaur leverages the key idea that formal API constraints can be learned from a small number of automatically generated seed inputs, and that the learned constraints can be solved using SMT solvers to generate valid and diverse test inputs.\nWe develop a novel grammar that represents first-order logic formulae over API parameters and expresses tensor-related properties (e.g., shape, data types) as well as relational properties between parameters. We use the grammar to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) to enumerate syntactically correct candidate rules, validated using seed inputs. Further, we develop a custom refinement strategy to prune the set of learned rules to eliminate spurious or redundant rules. We use the learned constraints to systematically generate valid and diverse inputs by integrating SMT-based solving with randomized sampling.\nWe evaluate Centaur for testing PyTorch and TensorFlow. Our results show that Centaur's constraints have a recall of 94.0% and a precision of 94.0% on average. In terms of coverage, Centaur covers 203, 150, and 9,608 more branches than TitanFuzz, ACETest and Pathfinder, respectively. Using Centaur, we also detect 26 new bugs in PyTorch and TensorFlow, 18 of which are confirmed.",

In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.",

While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks. Extensive experiments across model scales ranging from 8B to 235B demonstrate that our method delivers consistent and significant inference speedups over state-of-the-art baselines while preserving generation quality across diverse benchmarks.",

We compare general-purpose LLMs with task-specific transformers for operationalizing this model of character on major 19th-century British realist novels. Our methods yield both component-level and graph representations of character discussion.

        "abstract": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains an acute concern, contributing to the spread of misinformation and diminished public trust, particularly in high-risk domains. Among hallucination types, factuality is crucial, as it concerns a model's alignment with established world knowledge. Adversarial factuality, defined as the deliberate insertion of misinformation into prompts with varying levels of expressed confidence, tests a model's ability to detect and resist confidently framed falsehoods. Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.\nTo address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy. Performance scales non-linearly with model size, varies by domains, and gaps between difficulty levels narrow as models grow. Long-form evaluation reveals no significant correlation between injected misinformation and the model's factual output. AdversaRiskQA provides a valuable benchmark for pinpointing LLM weaknesses and developing more reliable models for high-stakes applications.",

Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.",

In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge.",

We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($\\pi$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction.",

In the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor, a VLM interprets task context from images and natural language to adapt the stiffness and damping parameters of a VIC controller. These parameters are further regulated using real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the VLA baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware, with improved success rates and reduced force violations. The overall success rate across all tasks increases from 9.86\\% to 17.29\\%, presenting a promising path towards safe contact-rich manipulation using VLAs.

However, controlling these robots is a major challenge. Stationary magnetic systems have a limited workspace, while mobile systems (e.g., coils on a robotic arm) suffer from a \"model-calibration bottleneck\", requiring complex, pre-calibrated physical models that are time-consuming to create and computationally expensive. This paper presents a compact, low-cost mobile magnetic manipulation platform that overcomes this limitation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our system features a compact four-electromagnet array mounted on a UR5 collaborative robot. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based control strategy is trained through a sim-to-real pipeline, enabling effective policy deployment within 15 minutes and significantly reducing setup time. We validated the platform by controlling a 7-mm magnetic capsule along 2D trajectories. Our DRL-based controller achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.18~mm for a square path and 1.50~mm for a circular path. We also demonstrated successful tracking over a clinically relevant, 30 cm * 20 cm workspace. This work demonstrates a rapidly deployable, model-free control framework capable of precise magnetic manipulation in a large workspace,validated using a 2D GI phantom.",

We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities.

However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems.",

However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs. We release YuFeng-XGuard as an open model family, including both a full-capacity variant and a lightweight version, to support a wide range of deployment scenarios.",

We evaluate eight mainstream MDLMs (up to 100B parameters) on 58 benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and programming. The results show that MDLMs still lag behind comparably sized autoregressive models, mainly because parallel probabilistic modeling weakens inter-token dependencies. Meanwhile, MDLMs exhibit adaptive decoding behavior: their parallelism and generation order vary significantly with the task domain, the stage of reasoning, and whether the output is correct. On tasks that require \"backward information\" (e.g., Sudoku), MDLMs adopt a solution order that tends to fill easier Sudoku blanks first, highlighting their advantages. Finally, we provide theoretical motivation and design insights supporting a Generate-then-Edit paradigm, which mitigates dependency loss while retaining the efficiency of parallel decoding.",

To address this limitation, we propose Data-Free Selective Unlearning (DFSU), a novel privacy-preserving framework that removes sensitive PII from an LLM without requiring its training data. Our approach first synthesizes pseudo-PII through language model inversion, then constructs token-level privacy masks for these synthetic samples, and finally performs token-level selective unlearning via a contrastive mask loss within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) subspace.

        "abstract": "While modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems achieve high fidelity for read-style speech, they struggle to generate Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), a specialized, low-intensity speech style essential for relaxation. The inherent challenges include ASMR's subtle, often unvoiced characteristics and the demand for zero-shot speaker adaptation. In this paper, we introduce DeepASMR, the first framework designed for zero-shot ASMR generation. We demonstrate that a single short snippet of a speaker's ordinary, read-style speech is sufficient to synthesize high-fidelity ASMR in their voice, eliminating the need for whispered training data from the target speaker. Methodologically, we first identify that discrete speech tokens provide a soft factorization of ASMR style from speaker timbre. Leveraging this insight, we propose a two-stage pipeline incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) for content-style encoding and a flow-matching acoustic decoder for timbre reconstruction. Furthermore, we contribute DeepASMR-DB, a comprehensive 670-hour English-Chinese multi-speaker ASMR speech corpus, and introduce a novel evaluation protocol integrating objective metrics, human listening tests, LLM-based scoring and unvoiced speech analysis. Extensive experiments confirm that DeepASMR achieves state-of-the-art naturalness and style fidelity in ASMR generation for anyone of any voice, while maintaining competitive performance on normal speech synthesis.",

It is a hybrid approach that integrates statistical estimation with machine learning. Starting from the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) shrinkage estimator, we decompose the LW covariance matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and apply a lightweight transformer-based neural network to learn a nonlinear eigenvalue shrinkage function. Trained with portfolio risk as the loss function, the resulting precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) estimator directly targets portfolio risk minimization. By conditioning on the sample-to-dimension ratio, the approach remains scalable across different sample sizes and asset universes. Empirical results on stock daily returns from Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P500) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower out-of-sample realized risk than benchmark approaches.

Meanwhile large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting natural language and unstructured data but lack deterministic, verifiable execution of complex business logic. To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the anatomy of the AI agent generated logic programs, and the role of humans and auxiliary tools in the lifecycle of a business initiative.",

Social robots have shown promise in reducing anxiety through emotional support, yet how such systems should balance psychological safety with effective instructional guidance remains an open question. In this work, we present a three-phase iterative design study of a robotic interview coach grounded in Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) and instructional scaffolding theory. Across three weekly sessions (N=8), we systematically explored how different interaction strategies shape users' emotional experience, cognitive load, and perceived utility. Phase I demonstrated that a PCT-based robot substantially increased perceived psychological safety but introduced a Safety-Guidance Gap, in which users felt supported yet insufficiently coached. Phase II revealed a Scaffolding Paradox: immediate feedback improved clarity but disrupted conversational flow and increased cognitive load, whereas delayed feedback preserved realism but lacked actionable specificity. To resolve this tension, Phase III introduced an Agency-Driven Interaction Mode that allowed users to opt in to feedback dynamically. Qualitative findings indicated that user control acted as an anxiety buffer, restoring trust, reducing overload, and reframing the interaction as collaborative rather than evaluative. Quantitative measures further showed significant reductions in interview-related social and communication anxiety, while maintaining high perceived warmth and therapeutic alliance. We synthesize these findings into an Adaptive Scaffolding Ecosystem framework, highlighting user agency as a key mechanism for balancing emotional support and instructional guidance in social robot coaching systems.",

Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent).

We study this by formalizing over-sharpening, a phenomenon where the policy collapses onto limited modes, suppressing valid alternatives. At a high level, we discover finite-batch updates intrinsically bias learning toward sampled modes, triggering a collapse that propagates globally via semantic coupling. To mitigate this, we propose inverse-success advantage calibration to prioritize difficult queries and distribution-level calibration to diversify sampling via a memory network.

Aerial robots offer superior maneuverability and search efficiency, but they also introduce new challenges in spatial perception, dynamic control, and safety assurance. In this paper, we propose AION for vision-based aerial ObjectNav without relying on external localization or global maps.

We evaluate AION on the AI2-THOR benchmark and further assess its real-time performance in IsaacSim using high-fidelity drone models.

With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach.

This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents.",

In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).\nEvaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises (\"Sycophancy\").\nThis work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.",

        "abstract": "The recent surge in popularity of Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 underscores the community's strong interest in multi-image composition tasks. Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm.

        "abstract": "Emotional information in speech plays a unique role in multimodal perception. However, current Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), similar to conventional speech emotion recognition (SER) systems, still treat emotion understanding as a simple classification problem. This provides limited interpretability of predictions, while leaving the LLMs' expressive and reasoning capabilities underutilized. In this work, we take the first step to reformulate SER as a deep reasoning problem through reinforcement learning (RL). We propose EmotionThinker, which is designed to generate accurate emotion predictions with interpretable explanations grounded in fine-grained acoustic cues. To achieve this, we first construct EmotionCoT-35K, an emotional reasoning dataset with Chain-of-Thought annotations and detailed captions. Second, we observe that current SpeechLLMs exhibit weak prosody perception, whereas prosodic cues constitute fundamental signals for interpreting emotions. To address this, we develop the prosody-enhanced foundation model EmotionThinker-Base, and demonstrate that prosody enhancement improves emotion understanding. Third, we introduce Group-Relative-Policy-Optimization with Progressive-Trust-aware-Reasoning-Reward (GRPO-PTR) for RL. Different from standard GRPO, which relies only on rule-based outcome rewards, GRPO-PTR progressively introduces reasoning reward, dynamically adjusts it with a trustworthiness weight reflecting the alignment between reasoning and outcome, and evaluates the overall reasoning quality with a reward model based on multi-dimensional criteria. EmotionThinker outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models both in emotion accuracy and explanation quality, advancing SER toward interpretable multimodal reasoning.

        "abstract": "Transformer-based models, despite their promise for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), suffer from an inherent low-pass filtering effect that limits their effectiveness. This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data.

We propose CoFi-Agent (Tool-Augmented Coarse-to-Fine Agent), a hybrid architecture targeting edge servers and gateways. It performs fast local perception and triggers conditional forensic refinement only when uncertainty is detected. CoFi-Agent runs an initial single-pass on a local 7B Audio-LLM, then a cloud controller gates difficult cases and issues lightweight plans for on-device tools such as temporal re-listening and local ASR. On the MMAR benchmark, CoFi-Agent improves accuracy from 27.20% to 53.60%, while achieving a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than an always-on investigation pipeline. Overall, CoFi-Agent bridges the perception gap via tool-enabled, conditional edge-cloud collaboration under practical system constraints.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems integrate document retrieval with large language models and have been widely adopted. However, in privacy-related scenarios, RAG introduces a new privacy risk: adversaries can issue carefully crafted queries to exfiltrate sensitive content from the underlying corpus gradually. Although recent studies have demonstrated multi-turn extraction attacks, they rely on heuristics and fail to perform long-term extraction planning. To address these limitations, we formulate the RAG extraction attack as an adaptive stochastic coverage problem (ASCP). In ASCP, each query is treated as a probabilistic action that aims to maximize conditional marginal gain (CMG), enabling principled long-term planning under uncertainty. However, integrating ASCP with practical RAG attack faces three key challenges: unobservable CMG, intractability in the action space, and feasibility constraints. To overcome these challenges, we maintain a global attacker-side state to guide the attack. Building on this idea, we introduce RAGCRAWLER, which builds a knowledge graph to represent revealed information, uses this global state to estimate CMG, and plans queries in semantic space that target unretrieved regions. In comprehensive experiments across diverse RAG architectures and datasets, our proposed method, RAGCRAWLER, consistently outperforms all baselines. It achieves up to 84.4% corpus coverage within a fixed query budget and deliver an average improvement of 20.7% over the top-performing baseline. It also maintains high semantic fidelity and strong content reconstruction accuracy with low attack cost. Crucially, RAGCRAWLER proves its robustness by maintaining effectiveness against advanced RAG systems employing query rewriting and multi-query retrieval strategies. Our work reveals significant security gaps and highlights the pressing need for stronger safeguards for RAG.",

A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

In real deployment, edits arrive as long streams, and existing editors often face a plasticity-stability dilemma: locate-then-edit \"hard writes\" can accumulate interference over time, while null-space-style \"hard preservation\" preserves only what is explicitly constrained, so past edits can be overwritten and unconstrained behaviors may deviate, degrading general capabilities in the many-edits regime. We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks.",

A TAP applet links a trigger to an action and must bind trigger outputs (ingredients) to action inputs (fields) to be executable. Prior work largely treats TAP as service-level prediction from natural language, which often yields non-executable applets that still require manual configuration. We study the function-level configuration problem: generating complete applets with correct ingredient-to-field bindings. We propose FARM (Field-Aware Resolution Model), a two-stage architecture for automated applet generation with full configuration. Stage 1 trains contrastive dual encoders with selective layer freezing over schema-enriched representations, retrieving candidates from 1,724 trigger functions and 1,287 action functions (2.2M possible trigger-action pairs). Stage 2 performs selection and configuration using an LLM-based multi-agent pipeline. It includes intent analysis, trigger selection, action selection via cross-schema scoring, and configuration verification. Agents coordinate through shared state and agreement-based selection. FARM achieves 81% joint accuracy on Gold (62% Noisy, 70% One-shot) at the function level, where both trigger and action functions must match the ground truth. For comparison with service-level baselines, we map functions to their parent services and evaluate at the service level. FARM reaches 81% joint accuracy and improves over TARGE by 23 percentage points. FARM also generates ingredient-to-field bindings, producing executable automation configurations.",

Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment. We evaluate MGRAL's active learning performance on detection tasks over PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the highest AL curve with convincing visualizations, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection.",

Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.\nThe exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines.

This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots.",

        "abstract": "Role-play prompting is known to steer the behavior of language models by injecting a persona into the prompt, improving their zero-shot reasoning capabilities. However, such improvements are inconsistent across different tasks or instances. This inconsistency suggests that zero-shot and role-play prompting may offer complementary strengths rather than one being universally superior. Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap. Experiments with widely-used LLMs demonstrate that Persona Switch consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to 5.13% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, we show that output confidence serves as an informative measure for selecting the more reliable output.",

Using FlexLLM, we build a complete inference system for the Llama-3.2 1B model in under two months with only 1K lines of code. The system includes: (1) a stage-customized accelerator with hardware-efficient quantization (12.68 WikiText-2 PPL) surpassing SpinQuant baseline, and (2) a Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT) plug-in for efficient long-context processing. On the AMD U280 FPGA at 16nm, the accelerator achieves 1.29$\\times$ end-to-end speedup, 1.64$\\times$ higher decode throughput, and 3.14$\\times$ better energy efficiency than an NVIDIA A100 GPU (7nm) running BF16 inference; projected results on the V80 FPGA at 7nm reach 4.71$\\times$, 6.55$\\times$, and 4.13$\\times$, respectively. In long-context scenarios, integrating the HMT plug-in reduces prefill latency by 23.23$\\times$ and extends the context window by 64$\\times$, delivering 1.10$\\times$/4.86$\\times$ lower end-to-end latency and 5.21$\\times$/6.27$\\times$ higher energy efficiency on the U280/V80 compared to the A100 baseline.

While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.",

This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

        "abstract": "An utterance-level speaker embedding is typically obtained by aggregating a sequence of frame-level representations. However, in real-world scenarios, individual frames encode not only speaker-relevant information but also various nuisance factors. As a result, different frames contribute unequally to the final utterance-level speaker representation for Automatic Speaker Verification systems. To address this issue, we propose to estimate the inherent uncertainty of each frame and assign adaptive weights accordingly, where frames with higher uncertainty receive lower attention. Based on this idea, we present U3-xi, a comprehensive framework designed to produce more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates for speaker embeddings. Specifically, we introduce several strategies for uncertainty supervision. First, we propose speaker-level uncertainty supervision via a Stochastic Variance Loss, where the distance between an utterance embedding and its corresponding speaker centroid serves as a pseudo ground truth for uncertainty learning. Second, we incorporate global-level uncertainty supervision by injecting the predicted uncertainty into the sof tmax scale during training. This adaptive scaling mechanism adjusts the sharpness of the decision boundary according to sample difficulty, providing global guidance. Third, we redesign the uncertainty estimation module by integrating a Transformer encoder with multi-view self-attention, enabling the model to capture rich local and long-range temporal dependencies. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that U3-xi is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly applied to various speaker encoders. In particular, when applied to ECAPA-TDNN, it achieves 21.1% and 15.57% relative improvements on the VoxCeleb1 test sets in terms of EER and minDCF, respectively.",

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.",

Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding.",

The key problem that arises in this context is to choose a limited number of highly influential users as the initial adopters of a brand such that the influence regarding the brand in the network gets maximized. Deviating from this standard setting, in this paper, we study the problem where every user of the network is associated with a selection cost and a benefit value. This benefit value can be earned from the user if (s)he is influenced by the brand. A fixed amount of budget is allocated for selecting the seed users. The goal of initial adopters is to choose a set of seed users within the budget such that the profit is maximized. We propose a two phase diffusion model for this problem where the goal is to split the diffusion process into two phases, and hence, split the budget into two halves. First, we spend the first half budget to select seed users for the first phase and observe the diffusion for a few rounds and then deploy the seed users for the second phase and successively complete the diffusion process. We prove several properties of the two phase influence function. Three solution approaches have been proposed for our problem with detailed analysis and illustrative examples. We conduct a number of experiments with three real-world social network datasets. From the experiments, we observe that the two phase diffusion approach leads to more amount of profit compared to the single-phase diffusion. In particular, for most instances, this improvement is greater than 18% and reaching as high as 40% by the proposed methodologies.",

Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization.

First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions.

To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains.

The flexible assembly flow shop scheduling problem formally defines dependencies for multi-stage kitting, yet dynamic variants make designing integrated scheduling rules under multi-level time coupling highly challenging. Existing automated heuristic design methods, particularly genetic programming constrained to fixed terminal symbol sets, struggle to capture and leverage dynamic uncertainties and hierarchical dependency information under transient decision states. This study develops an LLM-assisted Dynamic Rule Design framework (LLM4DRD) that automatically evolves integrated online scheduling rules adapted to scheduling features. Firstly, multi-stage processing and assembly supply decisions are transformed into feasible directed edge orderings based on heterogeneous graph. Then, an elite knowledge guided initialization embeds advanced design expertise into initial rules to enhance initial quality. Additionally, a dual-expert mechanism is introduced in which LLM-A evolutionary code to generate candidate rules and LLM-S conducts scheduling evaluation, while dynamic feature-fitting rule evolution combined with hybrid evaluation enables continuous improvement and extracts adaptive rules with strong generalization capability. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the method. The average tardiness of LLM4DRD is 3.17-12.39% higher than state-of-the-art methods in 20 practical instances used for training and testing, respectively. In 24 scenarios with different resource configurations, order loads, and disturbance levels totaling 480 instances, it achieves 11.10% higher performance than the second best competitor, exhibiting excellent robustness.",

Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns. We conclude that representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment and an evaluation focused on marginals can mask structural failures, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about model capabilities.",

As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \\textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.",

        "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in low-light image enhancement with respect to visual quality. However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap achieves superior enhancement performance with an extremely low storage footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement.",

In this work, we introduce Recursive Flow (RC-Flow), a novel solver that leverages pre-trained flow matching priors to robustly recover channel state information from noisy, under-determined measurements. Different from conventional open-loop generative models, our approach establishes a closed-loop refinement framework via a serial restart mechanism and anchored trajectory rectification. By synergizing flow-consistent prior directions with data-fidelity proximal projections, the proposed RC-Flow achieves robust channel reconstruction and delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse noise levels, particularly in noise-dominated scenarios. The framework is further augmented by an adaptive dual-scheduling strategy, offering flexible management of the trade-off between convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy. Theoretically, we analyze the Jacobian spectral radius of the recursive operator to prove its global asymptotic stability. Numerical results demonstrate that RC-Flow reduces inference latency by two orders of magnitude while achieving a 2.7 dB performance gain in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes compared to the score-based baseline.",

To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results.",

Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.",

Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment.

However, LLMs often lack a nuanced understanding of human cognition and behavior, limiting their effectiveness in social simulation and personalized applications. We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns. We then formulate diverse learning tasks and perform supervised fine-tuning to empower the model to predict a wide range of individualized human behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HumanLLM achieves superior performance in predicting user actions and inner thoughts, more accurately mimics user writing styles and preferences, and generates more authentic user profiles compared to base models. Furthermore, HumanLLM shows significant gains on out-of-domain social intelligence benchmarks, indicating enhanced generalization.",

We propose \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{O}ptimization for \\textbf{S}afety \\textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously.

Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching. Our attack substantially outperforms existing white-box attacks across all test models, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed GOSV framework on LLM safety interpretability.",

While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification.

It extracts a model's unique \"failure signature\", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.",

However, conventional methods often struggle when unforeseen traffic incidents occur (e.g., accidents and road maintenance), which typically require labor-intensive and inefficient manual interventions by traffic police officers. Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be a promising solution thanks to their remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability.",

Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x. The code repository is available online at here.",

The number is constrained by time and costs and lacks justification of the sample size requirements and their relationship to text vocabulary properties.\nMethods: Using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset containing hospital discharge notes with ICD-9 diagnoses as labels, we employed pre-trained BERT embeddings followed by Random Forest classifiers to identify 10 randomly selected diagnoses, varying training corpus sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents, and analyzed vocabulary properties by identifying strong and noisy predictive words through Lasso logistic regression on bag-of-words embeddings.\nResults: Learning curves varied significantly across the 10 classification tasks despite identical preprocessing and algorithms, with 600 documents sufficient to achieve 95% of the performance attainable with 10,000 documents for all tasks. Vocabulary analysis revealed that more strong predictors and fewer noisy predictors were associated with steeper learning curves, where every 100 additional noisy words decreased accuracy by approximately 0.02 while 100 additional strong predictors increased maximum accuracy by approximately 0.04.",

        "abstract": "General-purpose embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in text retrieval but remain suboptimal for table retrieval, where highly structured content leads to semantic compression and query-table mismatch. Recent LLM-based retrieval augmentation methods mitigate this issue by generating synthetic queries, yet they often rely on heuristic partial-table selection and seldom leverage these synthetic queries as supervision to improve the embedding model. We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, including QGpT, with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54 percent. In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval.

Although recent advances have greatly improved LLMs' code completion abilities, evaluation methods have not advanced equally. Most current benchmarks focus solely on functional correctness of code completions based on given context, overlooking models' ability to follow user instructions during completion-a common scenario in LLM-assisted programming. To address this limitation, we present the first instruction-guided code completion benchmark, Controllable Code Completion Benchmark (C3-Bench), comprising 2,195 carefully designed completion tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation of over 40 mainstream LLMs across C3-Bench and conventional benchmarks, we reveal substantial gaps in instruction-following capabilities between open-source and advanced proprietary models during code completion tasks. Moreover, we develop a straightforward data synthesis pipeline that leverages Qwen2.5-Coder to generate high-quality instruction-completion pairs for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The resulting model, Qwen2.5-Coder-C3, achieves state-of-the-art performance on C3-Bench. Our findings provide valuable insights for enhancing LLMs' code completion and instruction-following capabilities, establishing new directions for future research in code LLMs. To facilitate reproducibility and foster further research in code LLMs, we open-source all code, datasets, and models.",

To enable efficient knowledge learning and stable training, we incorporate a block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) stage enhanced by a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule. Under the same data and architecture, Stable-DiffCoder overall outperforms its AR counterpart on a broad suite of code benchmarks. Moreover, relying only on the CPT and supervised fine-tuning stages, Stable-DiffCoder achieves stronger performance than a wide range of \\~8B ARs and DLLMs, demonstrating that diffusion-based training can improve code modeling quality beyond AR training alone.

We investigate how users understand and wish to contribute to this process through a participatory workshop that combines misalignment diaries with generative design activities. We surface how misalignments materialise in practice and how users envision acting on them, grounded in the context of researchers using Large Language Models as research assistants. Our findings show that misalignments are experienced less as abstract ethical violations than as unexpected responses, and task or social breakdowns. Participants articulated roles ranging from adjusting and interpreting model behaviour to deliberate non-engagement as an alignment strategy.

TeNet conditions a hypernetwork on text embeddings produced by a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate a fully executable policy, which then operates solely on low-dimensional state inputs at high control frequencies. By using the language only once at the policy instantiation time, TeNet inherits the general knowledge and paraphrasing robustness of pretrained LLMs while remaining lightweight and efficient at execution time. To improve generalization, we optionally ground language in behavior during training by aligning text embeddings with demonstrated actions, while requiring no demonstrations at inference time. Experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that TeNet produces policies that are orders of magnitude smaller than sequence-based baselines, while achieving strong performance in both multi-task and meta-learning settings and supporting high-frequency control. These results show that text-conditioned hypernetworks offer a practical way to build compact, language-driven controllers for ressource-constrained robot control tasks with real-time requirements.",

However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and http://ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a \"Latency Wall\" exists in the classification stage. The YOLOv11n architecture offers the optimal balance for detection (~54 ms). However, general-purpose Transformers like CLIP and SigLIP fail to achieve viable accuracy (<23%) or speed (>150 ms) for real-time loops.

To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions.

Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches.

For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.",

We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction.

To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking.

To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics.

This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.",

Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.",

To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.",

To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles. We successfully transfer our policy to the real world and develop a teleoperation system where users could command the humanoid to traverse in cluttered indoor scenes with just a single click. Extensive experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate the effectiveness of our method. Demos and code can be found in our website: https://axian12138.github.io/CAT/.",

Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\\%$) and computational efficiency. By combining the scalability of deep learning with the biophysical rigor of process-based modeling, AgriPINN provides a robust and interpretable framework for spatio-temporal AGB prediction, offering practical value for planning of irrigation infrastructure, yield forecasting, and climate-adaptation planning.",

However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.",

While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.",

By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation.

To bridge this evaluation gap, we leverage image editing to achieve precise control over modification types and content, enabling a pipeline for synthesizing queries across a broad spectrum of categories. Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark. This experiment clarifies the task challenges by distinguishing between categories that are solvable with targeted data and those that expose intrinsic limitations of current model architectures.",

Updating one or more supported languages with additional data or adding support for a new language involves retraining the model, which can be computationally inefficient and creates a severe maintenance bottleneck. Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model. We show this on both public and proprietary industry datasets confirming that the approach works well for industrial use cases in addition to academic settings already studied in previous work.",

Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.",

As a pivotal component of the LAE, low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can restore communication by serving as aerial relays between the post-disaster areas and remote base stations (BSs). However, conventional approaches face challenges from vulnerable long-distance links between the UAVs and remote BSs, and data bottlenecks arising from massive data volumes and limited onboard UAV resources. In this work, we investigate a low-altitude multi-UAV-assisted data collection and semantic forwarding network, in which multiple UAVs collect data from ground users, form clusters, perform intra-cluster data aggregation with semantic extraction, and then cooperate as virtual antenna array (VAAs) to transmit the extracted semantic information to a remote BS via collaborative beamforming (CB). We formulate a data collection and semantic forwarding multi-objective optimization problem (DCSFMOP) that jointly maximizes both the user and semantic transmission rates while minimizing UAV energy consumption. The formulated DCSFMOP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is inherently NP-hard and characterized by dynamically varying decision variable dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model-enabled alternating optimization approach (LLM-AOA), which effectively handles the complex search space and variable dimensionality by optimizing different subsets of decision variables through tailored optimization strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that LLM-AOA outperforms AOA by approximately 26.8\\% and 22.9\\% in transmission rate and semantic rate, respectively.",

We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes \"in action\" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed \"temporal 3D diffusion\". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.",

Recent single encoder transformer approaches have framed harmonization as a masked sequence modeling problem, but existing training curricula inspired by discrete diffusion often result in weak (cross) attention between melody and harmony. This leads to limited exploitation of melodic cues, particularly in out-of-domain contexts. In this work, we introduce a training curriculum, FF (full-to-full), which keeps all harmony tokens masked for several training steps before progressively unmasking entire sequences during training to strengthen melody-harmony interactions. We systematically evaluate this approach against prior curricula across multiple experimental axes, including temporal quantization (quarter vs. sixteenth note), bar-level vs. time-signature conditioning, melody representation (full range vs. pitch class), and inference-time unmasking strategies. Models are trained on the HookTheory dataset and evaluated both in-domain and on a curated collection of jazz standards, using a comprehensive set of metrics that assess chord progression structure, harmony-melody alignment, and rhythmic coherence. Results demonstrate that the proposed FF curriculum consistently outperforms baselines in nearly all metrics, with particularly strong gains in out-of-domain evaluations where harmonic adaptability to novel melodic queues is crucial. We further find that quarter-note quantization, intertwining of bar tokens, and pitch-class melody representations are advantageous in the FF setting. Our findings highlight the importance of training curricula in enabling effective melody conditioning and suggest that full-to-full unmasking offers a robust strategy for single encoder harmonization.",

Therefore, this paper presents CONTEX-T, a novel framework that exploits contextual privacy vulnerabilities using spectral representation of encrypted wireless traffic for IoT device characterization. The experiments show that spectral analysis provides new and rich feature representation for covert reconnaissance attacks, revealing a complex and expanding threat landscape that would require robust countermeasures for IoT security management. CONTEXT-T first transforms raw packet length sequences into time-frequency spectral representations and then utilizes transformer-based spectral analysis for the device identification.

To leverage their spatiotemporal priors, robotics works have adapted video models for policy learning but introduce complexity by requiring multiple stages of post-training and new architectural components for action generation. In this work, we introduce Cosmos Policy, a simple approach for adapting a large pretrained video model (Cosmos-Predict2) into an effective robot policy through a single stage of post-training on the robot demonstration data collected on the target platform, with no architectural modifications. Cosmos Policy learns to directly generate robot actions encoded as latent frames within the video model's latent diffusion process, harnessing the model's pretrained priors and core learning algorithm to capture complex action distributions. Additionally, Cosmos Policy generates future state images and values (expected cumulative rewards), which are similarly encoded as latent frames, enabling test-time planning of action trajectories with higher likelihood of success. In our evaluations, Cosmos Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO and RoboCasa simulation benchmarks (98.5% and 67.1% average success rates, respectively) and the highest average score in challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, outperforming strong diffusion policies trained from scratch, video model-based policies, and state-of-the-art vision-language-action models fine-tuned on the same robot demonstrations. Furthermore, given policy rollout data, Cosmos Policy can learn from experience to refine its world model and value function and leverage model-based planning to achieve even higher success rates in challenging tasks.

To address this vulnerability, we propose the Feature-space Smoothing (FS) and theoretically prove that FS offers certified robustness on the feature representations of MLLMs. Specifically, FS transforms any feature encoder into a smoothed variant that is guaranteed to maintain a certified lower bound on the feature cosine similarity between clean and adversarial representations under $\\ell_2$-bounded attacks. Moreover, we indicate that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) derived from FS can be improved by enlarging the defined Gaussian robustness score on the vanilla encoder. Building upon this, we introduce the Purifier and Smoothness Mapper (PSM), a plug-and-play module that improves the Gaussian robustness score of MLLMs and thus enhances their certified robustness under FS, without requiring any retraining on MLLMs. We demonstrate that the FS with PSM not only provides a strong theoretical robustness guarantee but also exhibits superior empirical performance compared to adversarial training. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and downstream tasks indicate the effectiveness of the FS-PSM, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of various white-box attacks from nearly 90\\% to about 1\\%.",

We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%). All code and models will be released publicly. Visualizations are available at: http://jongwoopark7978.github.io/IVRA",

        "abstract": "Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) have shown distinct advantages in diffusion modeling on ImageNet by training in high-dimensional semantic latent spaces. In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models.",

To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.",

Simulation and synthetic data generation offer a scalable alternative, but their usefulness is limited by the visual domain gap between simulation and reality. In this work, we present Point Bridge, a framework that leverages unified, domain-agnostic point-based representations to unlock synthetic datasets for zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, without explicit visual or object-level alignment. Point Bridge combines automated point-based representation extraction via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), transformer-based policy learning, and efficient inference-time pipelines to train capable real-world manipulation agents using only synthetic data. With additional co-training on small sets of real demonstrations, Point Bridge further improves performance, substantially outperforming prior vision-based sim-and-real co-training methods. It achieves up to 44% gains in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and up to 66% with limited real data across both single-task and multitask settings.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in camera-controlled video diffusion models have significantly improved video-camera alignment. However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

        "abstract": "Adult neurodivergence, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Cognitive Disengagement Syndrome (CDS), is marked by substantial symptom overlap that limits the discriminant sensitivity of standard psychometric instruments. While recent work suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate human psychometric responses from qualitative data, it remains unclear whether they can accurately and stably model neurodevelopmental traits rather than broad personality characteristics. This study examines whether LLMs can generate psychometric responses that approximate those of real individuals when grounded in a structured qualitative interview, and whether such simulations are sensitive to variations in trait intensity. Twenty-six adults completed a 29-item open-ended interview and four standardized self-report measures (ASRS, BAARS-IV, AQ, RAADS-R). Two LLMs (GPT-4o and Qwen3-235B-A22B) were prompted to infer an individual psychological profile from interview content and then respond to each questionnaire in-role. Accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity were assessed using group-level comparisons, error metrics, exact-match scoring, and a randomized baseline. Both models outperformed random responses across instruments, with GPT-4o showing higher accuracy and reproducibility. Simulated responses closely matched human data for ASRS, BAARS-IV, and RAADS-R, while the AQ revealed subscale-specific limitations, particularly in Attention to Detail. Overall, the findings indicate that interview-grounded LLMs can produce coherent and above-chance simulations of neurodevelopmental traits, supporting their potential use as synthetic participants in early-stage psychometric research, while highlighting clear domain-specific constraints.",

Despite these advances, a substantial gap remains between RL research and its deployment in many practical settings. Two recurring challenges often underlie this gap. First, many settings offer limited opportunity for the agent to interact extensively with the target environment due to practical constraints. Second, many target environments often undergo substantial changes, requiring redesign and redeployment of RL systems (e.g., advancements in science and technology that change the landscape of healthcare delivery). Addressing these challenges and bridging the gap between basic research and application requires theory and methodology that directly inform the design, implementation, and continual improvement of RL systems in real-world settings.\nIn this paper, we frame the application of RL in practice as a three-component process: (i) online learning and optimization during deployment, (ii) post- or between-deployment offline analyses, and (iii) repeated cycles of deployment and redeployment to continually improve the RL system. We provide a narrative review of recent advances in statistical RL that address these components, including methods for maximizing data utility for between-deployment inference, enhancing sample efficiency for online learning within-deployment, and designing sequences of deployments for continual improvement. We also outline future research directions in statistical RL that are use-inspired -- aiming for impactful application of RL in practice.",

Our core architecture is simple: we feed VAE-compressed image latents to a ViT encoder and train its output to support two complementary roles. First, the encoder output is passed to the ViT-VAE decoder to reconstruct the original image, encouraging the representation to capture generative structure. Second, the same representation is optimized with contrastive learning and image-captioning objectives, strengthening semantic features. By jointly optimizing reconstruction- and semantics-driven signals in a shared latent space, the encoder learns representations that synergize and generalize well across both regimes. We validate this unified design through extensive downstream evaluations with the encoder frozen. For multimodal understanding, we plug the encoder into the LLaVA-1.5 framework: it performs comparably with a standard CLIP vision encoder (e.g., 62.4 vs 62.2 on SeedBench, and 83.7 vs 82.9 on POPE). For generation, we test it under the RAE framework: ours substantially surpasses the standard CLIP-based encoder (e.g., gFID: 1.89 vs 2.54 on ImageNet).

We show that, using a carefully designed choice of the time-discretization scheme and with sufficiently accurate drift estimates, the RF sampler enjoys an iteration complexity of order $O(k/\\varepsilon)$ (up to log factors), where $\\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of\nthe target distribution. In addition, we show that the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) procedure is equivalent to a stochastic version of RF by establishing a novel connection between these processes and stochastic localization. Building on this connection, we further design a stochastic RF sampler that also adapts to the low-dimensionality of the target distribution under milder requirements on the accuracy of the drift estimates, and also with a specific time schedule. We illustrate with simulations on the synthetic data and text-to-image data experiments the improved performance of the proposed samplers implementing the newly designed time-discretization schedules.",

However, existing direct S2ST systems continue to face notable challenges, including instability in semantic-acoustic alignment when parallel speech data is scarce, difficulty in preserving speaker identity, and limited multilingual scalability. In this work, we introduce DS2ST-LM, a scalable, single-stage direct S2ST framework leveraging a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM). The architecture integrates a Whisper speech encoder, a learnable projection module, a Qwen2-0.5B LLM, and a timbre-controlled vocoder. We construct GigaS2S-1000, a 1000-hour bilingual corpus by extending the GigaST dataset with high-fidelity synthetic target speech, and show that this synthetic data alleviates data scarcity to some extent. We investigate two semantic token generation strategies: speech-derived S3 tokens and text-derived tokens generated by a pre-trained LLM, and analyze their impact on training stability and semantic consistency. We further evaluate three projection architectures (Linear, Conv1D-Linear, and Q-Former) and observe that while higher-capacity projectors converge faster, the simple Linear projector achieves higher performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DS2ST-LM outperforms traditional cascaded and ST (Qwen-Audio) + TTS baselines across both lexical (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic (BLEURT, COMET) metrics, while extending to multiple language pairs, including French, Spanish, German, Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu.
