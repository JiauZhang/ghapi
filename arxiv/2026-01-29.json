Existing LLM-based approaches either generate assertions from scratch or ignore structural patterns in hardware designs and expert-crafted assertions. This paper presents STELLAR, the first framework that guides LLM-based SVA generation with structural similarity. STELLAR represents RTL blocks as AST structural fingerprints, retrieves structurally relevant (RTL, SVA) pairs from a knowledge base, and integrates them into structure-guided prompts.

        "abstract": "The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) is accelerating the integration of multimodal assistants into edge devices, where inference is executed under stringent latency and energy constraints, often exacerbated by intermittent connectivity. These challenges become particularly acute in the context of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), as high-dimensional visual inputs are transformed into extensive token sequences, thereby inflating the key-value (KV) cache and imposing substantial data movement overheads to the LLM backbone. To address these issues, we present CHIME, a chiplet-based heterogeneous near-memory acceleration for edge MLLMs inference. CHIME leverages the complementary strengths of integrated monolithic 3D (M3D) DRAM and RRAM chiplets: DRAM supplies low-latency bandwidth for attention, while RRAM offers dense, non-volatile storage for weights. This heterogeneous hardware is orchestrated by a co-designed mapping framework that executes fused kernels near data, minimizing cross-chiplet traffic to maximize effective bandwidth. On FastVLM (0.6B/1.7B) and MobileVLM (1.7B/3B), CHIME achieves up to 54x speedup and up to 246x better energy efficiency per inference as compared to the edge GPU NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX. It sustains 116.5-266.5 token/J compared to Jetson's 0.7-1.1 token/J. Furthermore, it delivers up to 69.2x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art PIM accelerator FACIL. Compared to the M3D DRAM-only design, CHIME's heterogeneous memory further improves energy efficiency by 7% and performance by 2.4x.",

In contrast, systematic analysis of modern large-scale LLMs remains limited, despite their rapid adoption in diverse application scenarios. Given the unique characteristics of LLMs, their resilience to soft errors may differ substantially from earlier models. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first instruction-level fault injection study of LLM inference.

We study whether expert detection can be treated as a learnable skill and improved through structured calibration. We introduce LREAD, a rubric derived from national Korean writing standards and adapted to target micro-level artifacts (e.g., punctuation optionality, spacing behavior, and register shifts). In a three-phase longitudinal blind protocol with Korean linguistics majors, Phase 1 measures intuition-only detection, Phase 2 enforces criterion-level scoring with explicit justifications, and Phase 3 evaluates domain-focused mastery on held-out elementary essays. Across phases, majority-vote accuracy increases from 60% to 100%, accompanied by stronger inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa: -0.09 --> 0.82). Compared to state-of-the-art LLM detectors, calibrated humans rely more on language-specific micro-diagnostics that are not well captured by coarse discourse priors. Our findings suggest that rubric-scaffolded expert judgment can serve as an interpretable complement to automated detectors for non-English settings, and we release the full rubric and a taxonomy of calibrated detection signatures.",

Our analysis reveals that LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked when conditioned on explicit plans from a teacher model; however, runtime reliance on external guidance is often impractical due to latency and availability constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose PILOT (Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories), a non-invasive framework designed to internalize the strategic oversight of large models into intrinsic Latent Guidance. Instead of altering backbone weights, PILOT employs a lightweight Hyper-Network to synthesize a query-conditioned Latent Guidance vector. This vector acts as an internal steering mechanism, guiding the model's representations toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on mathematical and coding benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT effectively stabilizes reasoning trajectories, consistently outperforming strong baselines (e.g., +8.9% on MATH500) with negligible inference latency.",

However, existing hallucination detection methods generally operate under unrealistic assumptions, i.e., either requiring expensive intensive sampling strategies for consistency checks or white-box LLM states, which are unavailable or inefficient in common API-based scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel efficient zero-shot metric called Lowest Span Confidence (LSC) for hallucination detection under minimal resource assumptions, only requiring a single forward with output probabilities. Concretely, LSC evaluates the joint likelihood of semantically coherent spans via a sliding window mechanism. By identifying regions of lowest marginal confidence across variable-length n-grams, LSC could well capture local uncertainty patterns strongly correlated with factual inconsistency. Importantly, LSC can mitigate the dilution effect of perplexity and the noise sensitivity of minimum token probability, offering a more robust estimate of factual uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and diverse benchmarks show that LSC consistently outperforms existing zero-shot baselines, delivering strong detection performance even under resource-constrained conditions.",

Studies show that, under homogeneous agents and uniform belief updates, debate preserves expected correctness and therefore cannot reliably improve outcomes. Drawing on findings from human deliberation and collective decision-making, we identify two key mechanisms missing from vanilla MAD: (i) diversity of initial viewpoints and (ii) explicit, calibrated confidence communication. We propose two lightweight interventions. First, a diversity-aware initialisation that selects a more diverse pool of candidate answers, increasing the likelihood that a correct hypothesis is present at the start of debate. Second, a confidence-modulated debate protocol in which agents express calibrated confidence and condition their updates on others' confidence. We show theoretically that diversity-aware initialisation improves the prior probability of MAD success without changing the underlying update dynamics, while confidence-modulated updates enable debate to systematically drift to the correct hypothesis. Empirically, across six reasoning-oriented QA benchmarks, our methods consistently outperform vanilla MAD and majority vote. Our results connect human deliberation with LLM-based debate and demonstrate that simple, principled modifications can substantially enhance debate effectiveness.",

Despite rapid progress in language models, we still lack a clear way to understand how their abilities in these interpersonal domains compare to those of humans. We introduce HEART, the first-ever framework that directly compares humans and LLMs on the same multi-turn emotional-support conversations. For each dialogue history, we pair human and model responses and evaluate them through blinded human raters and an ensemble of LLM-as-judge evaluators. All assessments follow a rubric grounded in interpersonal communication science across five dimensions: Human Alignment, Empathic Responsiveness, Attunement, Resonance, and Task-Following. HEART uncovers striking behavioral patterns. Several frontier models approach or surpass the average human responses in perceived empathy and consistency. At the same time, humans maintain advantages in adaptive reframing, tension-naming, and nuanced tone shifts, particularly in adversarial turns. Human and LLM-as-judge preferences align on about 80 percent of pairwise comparisons, matching inter-human agreement, and their written rationales emphasize similar HEART dimensions. This pattern suggests an emerging convergence in the criteria used to assess supportive quality. By placing humans and models on equal footing, HEART reframes supportive dialogue as a distinct capability axis, separable from general reasoning or linguistic fluency. It provides a unified empirical foundation for understanding where model-generated support aligns with human social judgment, where it diverges, and how affective conversational competence scales with model size.",

However, the boundaries of their capabilities in automated formulation and problem solving remain poorly understood, particularly when extending to complex, real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose OPT-ENGINE, an extensible benchmark framework designed to evaluate LLMs on optimization modeling with controllable and scalable difficulty levels. OPT-ENGINE spans 10 canonical tasks across operations research, with five Linear Programming and five Mixed-Integer Programming. Utilizing OPT-ENGINE, we conduct an extensive study of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, addressing two critical questions: 1.) Do LLMs' performance remain robust when generalizing to out-of-distribution optimization tasks that scale in complexity beyond current benchmark levels? and 2.) At what stage, from problem interpretation to solution generation, do current LLMs encounter the most significant bottlenecks? Our empirical results yield two key insights: first, tool-integrated reasoning with external solvers exhibits significantly higher robustness as task complexity escalates, while pure-text reasoning reaches a ceiling; second, the automated formulation of constraints constitutes the primary performance bottleneck. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing next-generation LLMs for advanced optimization.

To explore LLM's potential in assisting scientific review, this study examined ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5's consistency and reliability in evaluating abstracts compared to one another and to human reviewers. Methods: 160 abstracts from a local conference were graded by human reviewers and three LLMs using one rubric. Composite score distributions across three LLMs and fourteen reviewers were examined. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for within-AI reliability and AI-human concordance. Bland-Altman plots were examined for visual agreement patterns and systematic bias. Results: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent agreement with each other (ICCs: 0.59-0.87). ChatGPT and Claude reached moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and content-specific criteria, with ICCs ~.45-.60 for composite, impression, clarity, objective, and results. They exhibited fair agreement on subjective dimensions, with ICC ranging from 0.23-0.38 for impact, engagement, and applicability. Gemini showed fair agreement on half criteria and no reliability on impact and applicability. Three LLMs showed acceptable or negligible mean difference (ChatGPT=0.24, Gemini=0.42, Claude=-0.02) from the human mean composite scores. Discussion: LLMs could process abstracts in batches with moderate agreement with human experts on overall quality and objective criteria. With appropriate process architecture, they can apply a rubric consistently across volumes of abstracts exceeding feasibility for a human rater. The weaker performance on subjective dimensions indicates that AI should serve a complementary role in evaluation, while human expertise remains essential.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs)-based question answering (QA) systems play a critical role in modern AI, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, LLM-generated responses often suffer from hallucinations, unfaithful statements lacking reliable references. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks enhance LLM responses by incorporating external references but also introduce new forms of hallucination due to complex interactions between the retriever and generator. To address these challenges, researchers have explored attribution-based techniques that ensure responses are verifiably supported by retrieved content. Despite progress, a unified pipeline for these techniques, along with a clear taxonomy and systematic comparison of their strengths and weaknesses, remains lacking. A well-defined taxonomy is essential for identifying specific failure modes within RAG systems, while comparative analysis helps practitioners choose appropriate solutions based on hallucination types and application context. This survey investigates how attribution-based techniques are used within RAG systems to mitigate hallucinations and addresses the gap by: (i) outlining a taxonomy of hallucination types in RAG systems, (ii) presenting a unified pipeline for attribution techniques, (iii) reviewing techniques based on the hallucinations they target, and (iv) discussing strengths and weaknesses with practical guidelines. This work offers insights for future research and practical use of attribution techniques in RAG systems.",

We formalize the Contradiction-Preservation Principle, which requires that genuinely ambiguous expressions maintain non-zero entropy in their state representations, and develop extraction protocols using existing Large Language Models as interpretation generators. Empirical validation across 68 test sentences spanning lexical, structural, and pragmatic ambiguity demonstrates that our mapping achieves mean Shannon entropy H(S) = 1.087 bits for ambiguous inputs while baseline single-interpretation approaches yield H(S) = 0.000.

In practice, identical prompts do not always produce identical outputs, even when temperature and other decoding parameters are fixed. In this work, we conduct repeated-run experiments to empirically quantify baseline behavioural drift, defined as output variability observed when the same prompt is issued multiple times under operator-free conditions. We evaluate two publicly accessible models, gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b, across five prompt categories using exact repeats, perturbed inputs, and reuse modes at temperatures of 0.0 and 0.7. Drift is measured using unique output fractions, lexical similarity, and word count statistics, enabling direct comparison across models, prompting modes, and deployment types. The results show that nondeterminism persists even at temperature 0.0, with distinct variability patterns by model size, deployment, and prompt type. We situate these findings within existing work on concept drift, behavioural drift, and infrastructure-induced nondeterminism, discuss the limitations of lexical metrics, and highlight emerging semantic approaches. By establishing a systematic empirical baseline in the absence of stabilisation techniques, this study provides a reference point for evaluating future drift mitigation and control methods.",

To address this gap, we introduce \\textsc{Mem2ActBench}, a benchmark for evaluating whether agents can proactively leverage long-term memory to execute tool-based actions by selecting appropriate tools and grounding their parameters. The benchmark simulates persistent assistant usage, where users mention the same topic across long, interrupted interactions and expect previously established preferences and task states to be implicitly applied. We build the dataset with an automated pipeline that merges heterogeneous sources (ToolACE, BFCL, Oasst1), resolves conflicts via consistency modeling, and synthesizes 2,029 sessions with 12 user--assistant--tool turns on average. From these memory chains, a reverse-generation method produces 400 tool-use tasks, with human evaluation confirming 91.3\\% are strongly memory-dependent.

In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations. Extensive experiments on the WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks demonstrate that Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming prior baselines across various model sizes and input lengths.",

The framework supports fully automated assessment of compilation success, functional correctness via simulation, and synthesis feasibility/optimization.

Since cascaded architectures remain the dominant choice for complex tasks, existing cascaded streaming strategies attempt to reduce this latency via mechanical segmentation (e.g., fixed chunks, VAD-based splitting) or speculative generation, but they frequently either break semantic units or waste computation on predictions that must be rolled back. To address these challenges, we propose LTS-VoiceAgent, a Listen-Think-Speak framework that explicitly separates when to think from how to reason incrementally. It features a Dynamic Semantic Trigger to detect meaningful prefixes, and a Dual-Role Stream Orchestrator that coordinates a background Thinker (for state maintenance) and a foreground Speaker (for speculative solving). This parallel design enables \"thinking while speaking\" without blocking responses. We also introduce a Pause-and-Repair benchmark containing natural disfluencies to stress-test streaming robustness. Experiments across VERA, Spoken-MQA, BigBenchAudio, and our benchmark show that LTS-VoiceAgent achieves a stronger accuracy-latency-efficiency trade-off than serial cascaded baselines and existing streaming strategies.",

To address this, we propose a sample-efficient real-world human-in-the-loop RL framework named \\method, which requires fewer human intervention by actively selecting informative samples. Specifically, stable reduction of policy entropy enables improved trade-off between exploration and exploitation with higher sample efficiency. We first build influence functions of different samples on the policy entropy, which is efficiently estimated by the covariance of action probabilities and soft advantages of policies. Then we select samples with moderate values of influence functions, where shortcut samples that induce sharp entropy drops and noisy samples with negligible effect are pruned. Extensive experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that \\method achieves a 42.1\\% higher success rate while requiring 10.1\\% fewer human interventions compared to the state-of-the-art HiL-RL method, validating its effectiveness.

The proposed method is based on a dual formulation approach: Two numerical solutions, corresponding to conservative and nonconservative formulations of the same system, are evolved simultaneously. Since nonconservative schemes are known to produce nonphysical weak solutions near discontinuities, we exploit the difference between these two solutions to construct a smoothness indicator (SI). In smooth regions, the difference between the conservative and nonconservative solutions is of the same order as the truncation error of the underlying discretization, whereas in nonsmooth regions, it is ${\\cal O}(1)$. We apply this idea to the Euler equations of gas dynamics and define the SI using differences in the momentum and pressure variables. This choice allows us to further distinguish neighborhoods of contact discontinuities from other nonsmooth parts of the computed solution. The resulting classification is used to adaptively select numerical discretizations. In the vicinities of contact discontinuities, we employ the low-dissipation central-upwind numerical flux and a second-order piecewise linear reconstruction with the slopes computed using an overcompressive SBM limiter. Elsewhere, we use an alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) framework with the central-upwind finite-volume numerical fluxes and either unlimited (in smooth regions) or Ai-WENO-Z (in the nonsmooth regions away from contact discontinuities) fifth-order interpolation. Numerical results for the one- and two-dimensional compressible Euler equations show that the proposed adaptive method improves both the computational efficiency and resolution of complex flow features compared with the non-adaptive fifth-order A-WENO scheme.",

Detecting AI-generated text has therefore become a crucial technical and ethical issue. This paper presents a comprehensive study of AI-generated text detection based on large-scale corpora and novel training strategies. We introduce a 1-billion-token corpus of human-authored texts spanning multiple genres and a 1.9-billion-token corpus of AI-generated texts produced by prompting a variety of LLMs across diverse domains. Using these resources, we develop and evaluate numerous detection models and propose two novel training paradigms: Per LLM and Per LLM family fine-tuning. Across a 100-million-token benchmark covering 21 large language models, our best fine-tuned detector achieves up to $99.6\\%$ token-level accuracy, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines.",

We identify and characterize two key failure modes: the multilingual transfer bottleneck (correct language, incorrect task response) and the language consistency bottleneck (correct task response, wrong language). To systematically surface these issues, we design a four-scenario evaluation protocol spanning MMLU, MGSM, and XQuAD benchmarks. To probe these issues with interpretability, we extend logit lens analysis to track language probabilities layer by layer and compute cross-lingual semantic similarity of hidden states. The results reveal a three-phase internal structure: early layers align inputs into a shared semantic space, middle layers perform task reasoning, and late layers drive language-specific generation. Guided by these insights, we introduce selective fine-tuning of only the final layers responsible for language control. On Qwen-3-32B and Bloom-7.1B, this method achieves over 98 percent language consistency across six languages while fine-tuning only 3-5 percent of parameters, without sacrificing task accuracy. Importantly, this result is nearly identical to that of full-scope fine-tuning (for example, above 98 percent language consistency for both methods across all prompt scenarios) but uses a fraction of the computational resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage layer-localization of language control for efficient multilingual adaptation.",

Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn \"split dictionaries\", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks.",

However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on personalization benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods relative to strong baselines, especially in task-specific noisy scenarios.",

Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions.

We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator.

We present a neurosymbolic framework that combines LLMs with SMT solvers to produce verification-guided answers through iterative refinement. Our approach decomposes LLM outputs into atomic claims, autoformalizes them into first-order logic, and verifies their logical consistency using automated theorem proving. We introduce three key innovations: (1) multi-model consensus via formal semantic equivalence checking to ensure logic-level alignment between candidates, eliminating the syntactic bias of surface-form metrics, (2) semantic routing that directs different claim types to appropriate verification strategies: symbolic solvers for logical claims and LLM ensembles for commonsense reasoning, and (3) precise logical error localization via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the exact subset of claims to revise, transforming binary failure signals into actionable feedback. Our framework classifies claims by their logical status and aggregates multiple verification signals into a unified score with variance-based penalty. The system iteratively refines answers using structured feedback until acceptance criteria are met or convergence is achieved. This hybrid approach delivers formal guarantees where possible and consensus verification elsewhere, advancing trustworthy AI. With the GPT-OSS-120B model, VERGE demonstrates an average performance uplift of 18.7% at convergence across a set of reasoning benchmarks compared to single-pass approaches.",

A common assumption is that interpretability and performance are in tension: enforcing sparsity during training degrades accuracy, motivating recent post-hoc approaches such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). However, these post-hoc approaches often suffer from degraded downstream performance and loss of CLIP's inherent multimodal capabilities, with most learned features remaining unimodal.\nWe propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates sparsity directly into CLIP training, yielding representations that are both interpretable and performant. Compared to SAEs, our Sparse CLIP representations preserve strong downstream task performance, achieve superior interpretability, and retain multimodal capabilities. We show that multimodal sparse features enable straightforward semantic concept alignment and reveal training dynamics of how cross-modal knowledge emerges. Finally, as a proof of concept, we train a vision-language model on sparse CLIP representations that enables interpretable, vision-based steering capabilities. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom that interpretability requires sacrificing accuracy and demonstrate that interpretability and performance can be co-optimized, offering a promising design principle for future models.",

In prior work, we developed a design optimization framework that incorporates techno-economic considerations through surrogate modeling and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, focusing solely on minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by using a bottom-up cost estimation approach. In this study, we extend that framework to a multi-objective optimization that uses the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL) algorithm. The objectives include minimizing both the rod-integrated peaking factor ($F_{\\Delta h}$) and LCOE -- subject to safety and operational constraints. We evaluate three cost scenarios: (1) a high-cost axial and drum reflectors, (2) a low-cost axial reflector, and (3) low-cost axial and drum reflectors. Our findings indicate that reducing the solid moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle -- all while increasing the fuel height -- effectively lowers $F_{\\Delta h}$. Across all three scenarios, four key strategies consistently emerged for optimizing LCOE: (1) minimizing the axial reflector contribution when costly, (2) reducing control drum reliance, (3) substituting expensive tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel with axial reflector material priced at the level of graphite, and (4) maximizing fuel burnup. While PEARL demonstrates promise in navigating trade-offs across diverse design scenarios, discrepancies between surrogate model predictions and full-order simulations remain. Further improvements are anticipated through constraint relaxation and surrogate development, constituting an ongoing area of investigation.",

QAD distills a full-precision teacher model into a quantized student model using a KL divergence loss. While applying distillation to quantized models is not a new idea, we observe key advantages of QAD for today's LLMs: 1. It shows remarkable effectiveness and stability for models trained through multi-stage post-training pipelines, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and model merging, where traditional quantization-aware training (QAT) suffers from engineering complexity and training instability; 2. It is robust to data quality and coverage, enabling accuracy recovery without full training data. We evaluate QAD across multiple post-trained models including AceReason Nemotron, Nemotron 3 Nano, Nemotron Nano V2, Nemotron Nano V2 VL (VLM), and Llama Nemotron Super v1, showing consistent recovery to near-BF16 accuracy.",

Our approach models the closed-loop interaction between a user, an LLM-based agent, and an environment as a structural causal model (SCM), and leverages test-time scaling to generate multiple candidate counterfactual outcomes via probabilistic abduction.

Such human-AI collective knowledge ecosystems contain feedback loops with both benefits (e.g., faster growth, easier learning) and systemic risks (e.g., quality dilution, skill reduction, model collapse). To understand such phenomena, we propose a minimal, interpretable dynamical model of the co-evolution of archive size, archive quality, model (LLM) skill, aggregate human skill, and query volume. The model captures two content inflows (human, LLM) controlled by a gate on LLM-content admissions, two learning pathways for humans (archive study vs. LLM assistance), and two LLM-training modalities (corpus-driven scaling vs. learning from human feedback). Through numerical experiments, we identify different growth regimes (e.g., healthy growth, inverted flow, inverted learning, oscillations), and show how platform and policy levers (gate strictness, LLM training, human learning pathways) shift the system across regime boundaries. Two domain configurations (PubMed, GitHub and Copilot) illustrate contrasting steady states under different growth rates and moderation norms. We also fit the model to Wikipedia's knowledge flow during pre-ChatGPT and post-ChatGPT eras separately. We find a rise in LLM additions with a concurrent decline in human inflow, consistent with a regime identified by the model. Our model and analysis yield actionable insights for sustainable growth of human-AI collective knowledge on the Web.",

Unlike literal phrases, FFEs are culturally grounded, largely non-compositional, and conventionally fixed, making them especially vulnerable to figurative hallucination. We define figurative hallucination as the generation or endorsement of expressions that sound idiomatic and plausible but do not exist as authentic figurative expressions in the target language. We introduce FFEHallu, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating figurative hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on Persian, a linguistically rich yet underrepresented language. FFEHallu consists of 600 carefully curated instances spanning three complementary tasks: (i) FFE generation from meaning, (ii) detection of fabricated FFEs across four controlled construction categories, and (iii) FFE to FFE translation from English to Persian. Evaluating six state of the art multilingual LLMs, we find systematic weaknesses in figurative competence and cultural grounding. While models such as GPT4.1 demonstrate relatively strong performance in rejecting fabricated FFEs and retrieving authentic ones, most models struggle to reliably distinguish real expressions from high quality fabrications and frequently hallucinate during cross lingual translation. These findings reveal substantial gaps in current LLMs handling of figurative language and underscore the need for targeted benchmarks to assess and mitigate figurative hallucination.",

Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression. We also introduce Oracle Score Retention (OSR) protocol to evaluate how layer-wise information affects compression efficiency. Evaluations on the ViDoRe benchmark demonstrate that SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% while maintaining robust retrieval fidelity, providing a highly scalable solution for Visual RAG. Furthermore, our OSR-based analysis reveals that semantic structural anchor patches persist in the middle layers, unlike traditional pruning solutions that focus on the final layer where structural signals dissipate.",

Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Decision Importance Transformer(DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories. Then we train a transformer-based policy via a weighted maximum likelihood estimation loss, where the weights are constructed based on the trained value function to steer the suboptimal policies to the optimal ones. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of DIT on both bandit and Markov Decision Process problems. Our results show that DIT achieves superior performance, particularly when the offline dataset contains suboptimal historical data.",

Yet their susceptibility to privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) remains critically underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates. These findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, necessitating the development of tailored privacy defenses.",

We fine-tune and evaluate Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct on the MedMCQA and Hendrycks Math benchmarks using a ternary reward structure ($-1$, r_abs, 1) under varying abstention reward structures. We further study the effect of combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning strategies that teach abstention prior to reinforcement learning. Our results show that moderate abstention rewards (r_abs $\\approx -0.25$ to 0.3) consistently reduce incorrect responses without severe accuracy degradation on multiple-choice tasks, with larger models exhibiting greater robustness to abstention incentives. On open-ended question answering, we observe limitations due to insufficient exploration, which can be partially mitigated through supervised abstention training. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of verifiable reward design as a practical approach for hallucination mitigation in language models.

These systems operate in dynamic real-world environments where even small delays can undermine responsiveness and compromise performance. Asynchronous inference has recently emerged as a system-level paradigm for real-time robot manipulation, enabling the next action chunk to be predicted while the current one is being executed. While this approach achieves real-time responsiveness, naive integration often results in execution failure. Previous methods attributed this failure to inter-chunk discontinuity and developed test-time algorithms to smooth chunk boundaries. In contrast, we identify another critical yet overlooked factor: intra-chunk inconsistency, where the robot's executed action chunk partially misaligns with its current perception. To address this, we propose REMAC, which learns corrective adjustments on the pretrained policy through masked action chunking, enabling the policy to remain resilient under mismatches between intended actions and actual execution during asynchronous inference. In addition, we introduce a prefix-preserved sampling procedure to reinforce inter-chunk continuity. Overall, our method delivers more reliable policies without incurring additional latency. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method enables faster task execution, maintains robustness across varying delays, and consistently achieves higher completion rates.",

We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. \"-ight\") or answer to a question (\"whale\") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters. Our methodology offers a widely applicable direct way to study implicit planning abilities of LLMs. More broadly, understanding planning abilities of language models can inform decisions in AI safety and control.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion-based large multimodal models, such as LLaDA-V, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in vision-language understanding and generation. However, their bidirectional attention mechanism and diffusion-style iterative denoising paradigm introduce significant computational overhead, as visual tokens are repeatedly processed across all layers and denoising steps. In this work, we conduct an in-depth attention analysis and reveal that, unlike autoregressive decoders, LLaDA-V aggregates cross-modal information predominantly in middle-to-late layers, leading to delayed semantic alignment. Motivated by this observation, we propose a structured token pruning strategy inspired by FastV, selectively removing a proportion of visual tokens at designated layers to reduce FLOPs while preserving critical semantic information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate structured token pruning in diffusion-based large multimodal models. Unlike FastV, which focuses on shallow-layer pruning, our method targets the middle-to-late layers of the first denoising step to align with LLaDA-V's delayed attention aggregation to maintain output quality, and the first-step pruning strategy reduces the computation across all subsequent steps. Our framework provides an empirical basis for efficient LLaDA-V inference and highlights the potential of vision-aware pruning in diffusion-based multimodal models. Across multiple benchmarks, our best configuration reduces computational cost by up to 65% while preserving an average of 95% task performance.",

In this technical report, we present TeleStyle, a lightweight yet effective model for both image and video stylization. Built upon Qwen-Image-Edit, TeleStyle leverages the base model's robust capabilities in content preservation and style customization. To facilitate effective training, we curated a high-quality dataset of distinct specific styles and further synthesized triplets using thousands of diverse, in-the-wild style categories. We introduce a Curriculum Continual Learning framework to train TeleStyle on this hybrid dataset of clean (curated) and noisy (synthetic) triplets. This approach enables the model to generalize to unseen styles without compromising precise content fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a video-to-video stylization module to enhance temporal consistency and visual quality. TeleStyle achieves state-of-the-art performance across three core evaluation metrics: style similarity, content consistency, and aesthetic quality.

This paper presents AirAgent--an LLM-driven autonomous agent framework designed for home air systems. Leveraging a voice-based dialogue interface, AirAgent autonomously and personally manages indoor air quality through comprehensive perception, reasoning, and control. The framework innovatively adopts a two-layer cooperative architecture: Memory-Based Tag Extraction and Reasoning-Driven Planning. First, a dynamic memory tag extraction module continuously updates personalized user profiles. Second, a reasoning-planning model integrates real-time environmental sensor data, user states, and domain-specific prior knowledge (e.g., public health guidelines) to generate context-aware decisions. To support both interpretability and execution, we design a semi-streaming output mechanism that uses special tokens to segment the model's output stream in real time, simultaneously producing human-readable Chain-of-Thought explanations and structured, device-executable control commands. The system handles planning across 25 distinct complex dimensions while satisfying more than 20 customized constraints. As a result, AirAgent endows home air systems with proactive perception, service, and orchestration capabilities, enabling seamless, precise, and personalized air management responsive to dynamic indoor and outdoor conditions. Experimental results demonstrate up to 94.9 percent accuracy and more than 20 percent improvement in user experience metrics compared to competing commercial solutions.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances align diffusion models with human preferences to increase aesthetic appeal and mitigate artifacts and biases. Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to \"reward hacking\". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control. Our experiments show that across multiple text image alignment and image-quality metrics, our method consistently provides a strong approximation for models aligned entirely from scratch at different regularization strengths. Thus, our method yields an efficient way to search for the optimal strength, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps and thereby substantially reducing computational costs.",

However, sparse MoEs add complexity to training due to (i) new trainable parameters (router weights) that, like all other parameter groups, require hyperparameter (HP) tuning; (ii) new architecture scale dimensions (number of and size of experts) that must be chosen and potentially taken large. To make HP selection cheap and reliable, we propose a new parameterization for transformer models with MoE layers when scaling model width, depth, number of experts, and expert (hidden) size. Our parameterization is justified by a novel dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) analysis. When varying different model dimensions trained at a fixed token budget, we find empirically that our parameterization enables reliable HP transfer across models from 51M to over 2B total parameters. We further take HPs identified from sweeping small models on a short token horizon to train larger models on longer horizons and report performant model behaviors.",

Due to near-infinite degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and heterogeneous patterns, existing vision-based affordance prediction methods often suffer from boundary overflow and fragmented functional regions. To address these issues, we propose TRACER, a Texture-Robust Affordance Chain-of-thought with dEformable-object Refinement framework, which establishes a cross-hierarchical mapping from hierarchical semantic reasoning to appearance-robust and physically consistent functional region refinement. Specifically, a Tree-structured Affordance Chain-of-Thought (TA-CoT) is formulated to decompose high-level task intentions into hierarchical sub-task semantics, providing consistent guidance across various execution stages. To ensure spatial integrity, a Spatial-Constrained Boundary Refinement (SCBR) mechanism is introduced to suppress prediction spillover, guiding the perceptual response to converge toward authentic interaction manifolds. Furthermore, an Interactive Convergence Refinement Flow (ICRF) is developed to aggregate discrete pixels corrupted by appearance noise, significantly enhancing the spatial continuity and physical plausibility of the identified functional regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the Fine-AGDDO15 dataset and a real-world robotic platform demonstrate that TRACER significantly improves affordance grounding precision across diverse textures and patterns inherent to deformable objects. More importantly, it enhances the success rate of long-horizon tasks, effectively bridging the gap between high-level semantic reasoning and low-level physical execution.

Nevertheless, they still suffer from the sparse reward problem: the terminal reward of the entire denoising trajectory is applied to all intermediate steps, resulting in a mismatch between the global feedback signals and the exact fine-grained contributions at intermediate denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce \\textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space. Thus, we propose a reward-aware scheme to calibrate the exploration space by adaptively adjusting a timestep-specific stochasticity injection in the SDE sampler, ensuring a suitable exploration space at all timesteps. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DenseGRPO and highlight the critical role of the valid dense rewards in flow matching model alignment.",

Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates. Comprehensive benchmarks on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations demonstrate that ProFlow achieves superior physical and observational consistency, as well as more accurate distributional statistics, compared to state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based baselines.",

Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively.

        "abstract": "Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) adapts a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) to downstream tasks by inserting a small number of learnable prompt tokens into the token sequence at each layer. However, we observe that existing VPT variants often suffer from unstable training dynamics, characterized by gradient oscillations. A layer-wise analysis reveals that shallow-layer prompts tend to stagnate early, while deeper-layer prompts exhibit high-variance oscillations, leading to cross-layer mismatch. These issues slow convergence and degrade final performance. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Evolution ($\\mathtt{PAE}$), which strengthens vision prompt tuning by explicitly modeling prompt dynamics. From a frequency-domain perspective, we initialize prompts in a task-aware direction by uncovering and propagating frequency shortcut patterns that the backbone inherently exploits for recognition. To ensure coherent evolution across layers, we employ a shared Koopman operator that imposes a global linear transformation instead of uncoordinated, layer-specific updates. Finally, inspired by Lyapunov stability theory, we introduce a regularizer that constrains error amplification during evolution. Extensive experiments show that $\\mathtt{PAE}$ accelerates convergence with an average $1.41\\times$ speedup and improves accuracy by 1--3% on 25 datasets across multiple downstream tasks. Beyond performance, $\\mathtt{PAE}$ is prompt-agnostic and lightweight, and it integrates seamlessly with diverse VPT variants without backbone modification or inference-time changes.",

        "abstract": "Fine-grained and contact-rich manipulation remain challenging for robots, largely due to the underutilization of tactile feedback. To address this, we introduce TouchGuide, a novel cross-policy visuo-tactile fusion paradigm that fuses modalities within a low-dimensional action space. Specifically, TouchGuide operates in two stages to guide a pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching visuomotor policy at inference time. First, the policy produces a coarse, visually-plausible action using only visual inputs during early sampling. Second, a task-specific Contact Physical Model (CPM) provides tactile guidance to steer and refine the action, ensuring it aligns with realistic physical contact conditions. Trained through contrastive learning on limited expert demonstrations, the CPM provides a tactile-informed feasibility score to steer the sampling process toward refined actions that satisfy physical contact constraints. Furthermore, to facilitate TouchGuide training with high-quality and cost-effective data, we introduce TacUMI, a data collection system. TacUMI achieves a favorable trade-off between precision and affordability; by leveraging rigid fingertips, it obtains direct tactile feedback, thereby enabling the collection of reliable tactile data. Extensive experiments on five challenging contact-rich tasks, such as shoe lacing and chip handover, show that TouchGuide consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visuo-tactile policies.",

Under standard assumptions on the neural network classes used to parameterize the velocity field and data distribution, we prove that rectified flows achieve sample complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$. This improves on the best known $O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$ bounds for flow matching model and matches the optimal rate for mean estimation. Our analysis exploits the particular structure of rectified flows: because the model is trained with a squared loss along linear paths, the associated hypothesis class admits a sharply controlled localized Rademacher complexity. This yields the improved, order-optimal sample complexity and provides a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of rectified flow models.",

We introduce a framework for automated benchmark generation from expert-authored guidelines informed by Bloom's Taxonomy.

Standard metrics such as Perplexity (PPL) are compromised by the \"Long-Context Tax\" and exhibit weak correlation with downstream SWE performance.

Crucially, we propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, redefining intelligence not by scalar Top-1 compression, but by the capacity to structure uncertainty into Entropy-Compressed States of low orders (\"reasonable hesitation\"). Grounded in this fine-grained entropy analysis, we formulate a novel metric, HE-SNR (High-Entropy Signal-to-Noise Ratio).

This issue arises from the accumulation of noise errors inherent in the Markov process, leading to inconsistency and degradation in the fused results.

In particular, we introduce an \"answer sensitivity\" mechanism that guides Least-to-Most's iterative approach to enhance reasoning and yield higher prediction accuracy. We evaluate our framework using three URL datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing against a one-shot approach and a supervised model. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the one-shot baseline while achieving performance comparable to that of the supervised model, despite requiring significantly less training data. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis highlights how the iterative reasoning enabled by Least-to-Most, and reinforced by our answer sensitivity mechanism, drives these performance gains. Overall, we show that this simple yet powerful prompting strategy consistently outperforms both one-shot and supervised approaches, despite requiring minimal training or few-shot guidance.

While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap.

However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

Despite recent advances in XAI have provided some insights, the specific role of attention layers in transformer based LLMs remains underexplored. This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords. We provide converging evidence for this keywords-as-cues hypothesis. In addition, we isolate neurons within attention layers whose activations selectively encode and facilitate the retrieval of context-defining keywords. Consequently, these keywords can be extracted from identified neurons and further contribute to downstream applications such as unlearning.",

        "abstract": "Neural ranking models (NRMs) achieve strong retrieval effectiveness, yet prior work has shown they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We revisit this robustness question with a minimal, query-aware attack that promotes a target document by inserting or substituting a single, semantically aligned word - the query center. We study heuristic and gradient-guided variants, including a white-box method that identifies influential insertion points. On TREC-DL 2019/2020 with BERT and monoT5 re-rankers, our single-word attacks achieve up to 91% success while modifying fewer than two tokens per document on average, achieving competitive rank and score boosts with far fewer edits under a comparable white-box setup to ensure fair evaluation against PRADA. We also introduce new diagnostic metrics to analyze attack sensitivity beyond aggregate success rates. Our analysis reveals a Goldilocks zone in which mid-ranked documents are most vulnerable. These findings demonstrate practical risks and motivate future defenses for robust neural ranking.",

Existing approaches typically offer coarse video quality scores, lacking detailed localization and categorization of specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol focusing on three key aspects affecting human perception: Appearance, Motion, and Camera. We define these axes through a taxonomy of 10 prevalent artifact categories reflecting common generative failures observed in video generation. To enable robust artifact detection and categorization, we introduce GenVID, a large-scale dataset of 80k videos generated by various state-of-the-art video generation models, each carefully annotated for the defined artifact categories. Leveraging GenVID, we develop DVAR, a Dense Video Artifact Recognition framework for fine-grained identification and classification of generative artifacts. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves artifact detection accuracy and enables effective filtering of low-quality content.",

In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.",

LoRA provides efficient low-rank adaptation, while soft MoE promotes flexible expert sharing across languages, reducing cross-lingual interference. To further mitigate forgetting, we introduce limited replay data from existing languages, avoiding reliance on large historical corpora.

However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.",

To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy.

Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior generalization capability in real-world scenarios.",

We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings.

        "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting enables efficient optimization and high-quality rendering, yet accurate surface reconstruction remains challenging. Prior methods improve surface reconstruction by refining Gaussian depth estimates, either via multi-view geometric consistency or through monocular depth priors. However, multi-view constraints become unreliable under large geometric discrepancies, while monocular priors suffer from scale ambiguity and local inconsistency, ultimately leading to inaccurate Gaussian depth supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates the visibility of shared Gaussian primitives across views, enabling more accurate and stable geometric supervision. In addition, we propose a progressive quadtree-calibrated Monocular depth constraint that performs block-wise affine calibration from coarse to fine spatial scales, mitigating the scale ambiguity of depth priors while preserving fine-grained surface details. Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

Block-wise diffusion can reduce this cost, yet it typically relies on retraining and constrained update orders, limiting its direct applicability to pretrained DLMs. Our token-level analysis reveals pronounced structural locality in DLM inference. Decoding is driven by a small set of prefix-localized active tokens; the influence of distant undecoded context diminishes rapidly, and decoded tokens exhibit stage-wise temporal stability, enabling reuse of intermediate representations except for a brief post-decode transient.

Computation is restricted to active and buffer tokens within the window, while far-field tokens are omitted at each stage.

We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

To address these limitations, this paper presents multimodal multi agent ransomware analysis framework designed for ransomware classification. Proposed multimodal multiagent architecture combines information from static, dynamic and network sources. Each data type is handled by specialized agent that uses auto encoder based feature extraction. These representations are then integrated through a fusion agent. After that fused representation are used by transformer based classifier. It identifies the specific ransomware family. The agents interact through an interagent feedback mechanism that iteratively refines feature representations by suppressing low confidence information. The framework was evaluated on large scale datasets containing thousands of ransomware and benign samples. Multiple experiments were conducted on ransomware dataset. It outperforms single modality and nonadaptive fusion baseline achieving improvement of up to 0.936 in Macro-F1 for family classification and reducing calibration error. Over 100 epochs, the agentic feedback loop displays a stable monotonic convergence leading to over +0.75 absolute improvement in terms of agent quality and a final composite score of around 0.88 without fine tuning of the language models. Zeroday ransomware detection remains family dependent on polymorphism and modality disruptions.

Most deep palmprint models assume a closed and stationary distribution, leading to overfitting to dataset-specific textures rather than learning domain-invariant representations. Although data augmentation is commonly used to mitigate this issue, it assumes augmented samples can approximate the target deployment distribution, an assumption that often fails under significant domain mismatch. To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights. Experiments on multiple palmprint datasets and backbone architectures show that PalmBridge consistently reduces EER in intra-dataset open-set evaluation and improves cross-dataset generalization with negligible to modest runtime overhead.",

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.",

In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.",

Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.",

However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.",

We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.",

        "abstract": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.",

We propose STORM (Slot-based Task-aware Object-centric Representation for robotic Manipulation), a lightweight object-centric adaptation module that augments frozen visual foundation models with a small set of semantic-aware slots for robotic manipulation. Rather than retraining large backbones, STORM employs a multi-phase training strategy: object-centric slots are first stabilized through visual--semantic pretraining using language embeddings, then jointly adapted with a downstream manipulation policy. This staged learning prevents degenerate slot formation and preserves semantic consistency while aligning perception with task objectives. Experiments on object discovery benchmarks and simulated manipulation tasks show that STORM improves generalization to visual distractors, and control performance compared to directly using frozen foundation model features or training object-centric representations end-to-end. Our results highlight multi-phase adaptation as an efficient mechanism for transforming generic foundation model features into task-aware object-centric representations for robotic control.",

Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HINT matches the performance of strong offline models and surpasses autoregressive baselines. Notably, on InterHuman, HINT achieves an FID of 3.100, significantly improving over the previous state-of-the-art score of 5.154.",

However, it is often underestimated in the field due to lack of singing face datasets and the domain gap between singing and talking in rhythm and amplitude. More significantly, the quality of Singing Face Generation (SFG) often falls short and is uneven or limited by different applicable scenarios, which prompts us to propose timely and effective quality assessment methods to ensure user experience. To address existing gaps in this domain, this paper introduces a new SFG content quality assessment dataset SFQA, built using 12 representative generation methods. During the construction of the dataset, 100 photographs or portraits, as well as 36 music clips from 7 different styles, are utilized to generate 5,184 singing face videos that constitute the SFQA dataset. To further explore the quality of SFG methods, subjective quality assessment is conducted by evaluators, whose ratings reveal a significant variation in quality among different generation methods. Based on our proposed SFQA dataset, we comprehensively benchmark the current objective quality assessment algorithms.",

However, these generative views can be incorrect because diffusion generation may introduce hallucinated visual cues that conflict with the original query text. Indeed, we empirically demonstrate that these hallucinated cues can substantially degrade DAI-TIR performance. To address this, we propose Diffusion-aware Multi-view Contrastive Learning (DMCL), a hallucination-robust training framework that casts DAI-TIR as joint optimization over representations of query intent and the target image. DMCL introduces semantic-consistency and diffusion-aware contrastive objectives to align textual and diffusion-generated query views while suppressing hallucinated query signals. This yields an encoder that acts as a semantic filter, effectively mapping hallucinated cues into a null space, improving robustness to spurious cues and better representing the user's intent. Attention visualization and geometric embedding-space analyses corroborate this filtering behavior. Across five standard benchmarks, DMCL delivers consistent improvements in multi-round Hits@10, reaching as high as 7.37\\% over prior fine-tuned and zero-shot baselines, which indicates it is a general and robust training framework for DAI-TIR.",

Contemporary learning techniques primarily focus on structured learning paths, knowledge tracing, and generic adaptive testing but fail to address real-time learning challenges driven by cognitive load, attention fluctuations, and engagement levels. Building on findings from a formative user study (N=66), we introduce GuideAI, a multi-modal framework that enhances LLM-driven learning by integrating real-time biosensory feedback including eye gaze tracking, heart rate variability, posture detection, and digital note-taking behavior. GuideAI dynamically adapts learning content and pacing through cognitive optimizations (adjusting complexity based on learning progress markers), physiological interventions (breathing guidance and posture correction), and attention-aware strategies (redirecting focus using gaze analysis). Additionally, GuideAI supports diverse learning modalities, including text-based, image-based, audio-based, and video-based instruction, across varied knowledge domains. A preliminary study (N = 25) assessed GuideAI's impact on knowledge retention and cognitive load through standardized assessments. The results show statistically significant improvements in both problem-solving capability and recall-based knowledge assessments. Participants also experienced notable reductions in key NASA-TLX measures including mental demand, frustration levels, and effort, while simultaneously reporting enhanced perceived performance. These findings demonstrate GuideAI's potential to bridge the gap between current LLM-based learning systems and individualized learner needs, paving the way for adaptive, cognition-aware education at scale.",

Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem. We implement 12 sparse ConCA variants and demonstrate their ability to extract meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, offering theory-backed advantages over SAEs.",

This structured pipeline ensures guaranteed symmetry, coherent part placement, and diverse, high-quality outputs. By disentangling the generative process into interpretable components, our method supports fine-grained control over shape attributes, enabling targeted manipulation of individual parts while preserving global consistency. A central global latent further reinforces structural coherence across assembled parts. Our experiments show that the Quartet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

        "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to its exceptional rendering performance and visual quality. While most existing methods rely on rasterization to render Gaussians, recent research has started investigating ray tracing approaches to overcome the fundamental limitations inherent in rasterization. However, current Gaussian ray tracing methods suffer from inefficiencies such as bloated acceleration structures and redundant node traversals, which greatly degrade ray tracing performance.\nIn this work, we present GRTX, a set of software and hardware optimizations that enable efficient ray tracing for 3D Gaussian-based rendering. First, we introduce a novel approach for constructing streamlined acceleration structures for Gaussian primitives. Our key insight is that anisotropic Gaussians can be treated as unit spheres through ray space transformations, which substantially reduces BVH size and traversal overhead. Second, we propose dedicated hardware support for traversal checkpointing within ray tracing units. This eliminates redundant node visits during multi-round tracing by resuming traversal from checkpointed nodes rather than restarting from the root node in each subsequent round. Our evaluation shows that GRTX significantly improves ray tracing performance compared to the baseline ray tracing method with a negligible hardware cost.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents Youtu-Parsing, an efficient and versatile document parsing model designed for high-performance content extraction. The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong robustness when handling rare characters, multilingual text, and handwritten content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both the OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks. Overall, Youtu-Parsing demonstrates significant experimental value and practical utility for large-scale document intelligence applications.",

        "abstract": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is becoming increasingly essential for enhancing the transparency of machine learning (ML) models. Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.",

In this paper, we investigate an optimal control problem governed by the Fokker--Planck equation on a star graph, with a bilinear control appearing in the drift. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation and prove the existence of at least one optimal control. The associated adjoint system is derived, and first-order necessary optimality conditions are formulated. A wavelet-based numerical scheme is proposed to approximate the optimal solution, and its performance is illustrated through representative numerical experiments.

Motivated by this insight, we propose to \"contaminate\" real images using the generator's final component and train a detector to distinguish them from the original real images. We further introduce a taxonomy based on generators' final components and categorize 21 widely used generators accordingly, enabling a comprehensive investigation of our method's generalization capability.

The developed theory is used to solve three typical problem involved in many mechanical designs and engineering applications: at material level, how to generate the stress-strain response outside the range of experimental conditions based on experimentally measured stress-strain data; at structure level, how to generate the temperature-dependent stress fields under the thermal loading; at system level, how to generate the plastic strain fields under transient dynamic loading. Our results show the proposed theory can complete the generation successfully, showing its potential to solve many difficult problems involved in engineering applications, not limited to mechanics problems, such as image generation.

Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \\textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation.

Our approach is evaluated by computer science educators, who assessed 150 diagrams generated with large language models (LLMs) for logical organization, connectivity, layout aesthetic, and AI hallucination. The assessment dataset is additionally investigated for its utility in automated diagram evaluation. The preliminary results suggest that our method decreases the rate of factual hallucination and improves diagram faithfulness to provided context; however, due to LLMs' stochasticity, the quality of the generated diagrams varies. Additionally, we present an in-depth analysis and discussion on the connection between AI hallucination and the quality of generated diagrams, which reveals that text contexts of higher complexity lead to higher rates of hallucination and LLMs often fail to detect mistakes in their output.",

ConStruM constructs a lightweight, reusable structure in which, at query time, it assembles a small context pack emphasizing the most discriminative evidence. ConStruM is designed as an add-on: given a shortlist of candidate targets produced by an upstream matcher, it augments the matcher's final LLM prompt with structured, query-specific evidence so that the final selection is better grounded. For this purpose, we develop a context tree for budgeted multi-level context retrieval and a global similarity hypergraph that surfaces groups of highly similar columns (on both the source and target sides), summarized via group-aware differentiation cues computed online or precomputed offline.

LTD measures frame-to-frame variation in the latent space, assigning larger penalties to regions with higher discrepancy while maintaining regular optimization for stable regions. This motion-aware strategy stabilizes training and enables the model to better reconstruct high-frequency dynamics.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems have substantially increased the realism of synthetic speech, raising new challenges for audio deepfake detection. This work presents a comparative evaluation of three state-of-the-art TTS models--Dia2, Maya1, and MeloTTS--representing streaming, LLM-based, and non-autoregressive architectures. A corpus of 12,000 synthetic audio samples was generated using the Daily-Dialog dataset and evaluated against four detection frameworks, including semantic, structural, and signal-level approaches. The results reveal significant variability in detector performance across generative mechanisms: models effective against one TTS architecture may fail against others, particularly LLM-based synthesis. In contrast, a multi-view detection approach combining complementary analysis levels demonstrates robust performance across all evaluated models. These findings highlight the limitations of single-paradigm detectors and emphasize the necessity of integrated detection strategies to address the evolving landscape of audio deepfake threats.",

Although combinatorial complexes offer a unified topological framework, most existing topological deep learning methods rely on local message passing via attention mechanisms, which incur quadratic complexity and remain low-dimensional, limiting scalability and rank-aware information aggregation in higher-order http://complexes.We propose Combinatorial Complex Mamba (CCMamba), the first unified mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes. CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Experiments on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks demonstrate that CCMamba consistently outperforms existing methods while exhibiting improved scalability and robustness to depth.",

        "abstract": "Recent diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) suffer from high inference latency and therefore rely on caching techniques to accelerate decoding. However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \\textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \\textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments. Overall, we propose this framework as a common evaluation standard enabling consistent, goal-oriented comparison of multi-robot field trials and supporting systematic development of robotic systems for future planetary exploration.",

We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.",

The widely used Divergent Association Task (DAT) focuses on novelty, ignoring appropriateness, a core component of creativity. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs on DAT and show that their scores on the task are lower than those of two baselines that do not possess any creative abilities, undermining its validity for model evaluation. Grounded in human creativity theory, which defines creativity as the combination of novelty and appropriateness, we introduce Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT). CDAT evaluates novelty conditional on contextual appropriateness, separating noise from creativity better than DAT, while remaining simple and objective. Under CDAT, smaller model families often show the most creativity, whereas advanced families favor appropriateness at lower novelty. We hypothesize that training and alignment likely shift models along this frontier, making outputs more appropriate but less creative. We release the dataset and code.",

Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning.

Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics.

We introduce PURGE (Policy Unlearning through Relative Group Erasure), a novel method grounded in the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework that formulates unlearning as a verifiable problem. PURGE uses an intrinsic reward signal that penalizes any mention of forbidden concepts, allowing safe and consistent unlearning. Our approach reduces token usage per target by up to a factor of 46 compared with SotA methods, while improving fluency by 5.48 percent and adversarial robustness by 12.02 percent over the base model. On the Real World Knowledge Unlearning (RWKU) benchmark, PURGE achieves 11 percent unlearning effectiveness while preserving 98 percent of original utility. PURGE shows that framing LLM unlearning as a verifiable task, enables more reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting, suggesting a promising new direction for unlearning research that combines theoretical guarantees, improved safety, and practical deployment efficiency.",

However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.",

We model commuters as reinforcement learning agents who adapt their travel choices at different learning rates, reflecting unequal access to resources and information. To capture potential efficiency-fairness tradeoffs, we introduce the Price of Learning (PoL), a measure of inefficiency during learning. We analyze both a stylized network -- inspired in the well-known Braess's paradox, yet with two-source nodes -- and an abstraction of a real-world metro system (Amsterdam). Our simulations show that network expansions can simultaneously increase efficiency and amplify inequality, especially when faster learners disproportionately benefit from new routes before others adapt. These results highlight that transport policies must account not only for equilibrium outcomes but also for the heterogeneous ways commuters adapt, since both shape the balance between efficiency and fairness.",

Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis.

        "abstract": "Ordinal regression and ranking are challenging due to inherent ordinal dependencies that conventional methods struggle to model. We propose Ranking-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a novel RL framework that explicitly learns these relationships. At its core, RARL features a unified objective that synergistically integrates regression and Learning-to-Rank (L2R), enabling mutual improvement between the two tasks. This is driven by a ranking-aware verifiable reward that jointly assesses regression precision and ranking accuracy, facilitating direct model updates via policy optimization. To further enhance training, we introduce Response Mutation Operations (RMO), which inject controlled noise to improve exploration and prevent stagnation at saddle points. The effectiveness of RARL is validated through extensive experiments on three distinct benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) is a challenging multimodal continual learning setting, where models must incrementally learn new semantic categories while maintaining accurate text-video alignment for previously learned ones, thus making it particularly prone to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry. In addition, to suppress intra-modal feature drift, we design a Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss, which leverages complementary modalities to preserve cross-modal similarity relations, providing stable relational supervision for feature updates. By jointly addressing non-cooperative feature drift across modalities and intra-modal feature drift, StructAlign effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CTVR. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art continual retrieval approaches.",

Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.\nOur experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.\nResults demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of \"VCW as transitional framework.\" Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.\nThe framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.",

However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.",

However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks.

By strategically poisoning retrieval contexts through a mutation-based approach, DrainCode forces LLMs to produce significantly longer outputs, thereby increasing GPU latency and energy consumption. We evaluate the effectiveness of DrainCode across multiple models. Our experiments show that DrainCode achieves up to an 85% increase in latency, a 49% increase in energy consumption, and more than a 3x increase in output length compared to the baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of the attack across different prompting strategies and its effectiveness compared to different defenses.

Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.",

To address this, we introduce an interaction paradigm where users convey dynamic intent to a vision-language model via free-form sketching, instantiated here in a sketch storyboard to motion graphics workflow. We implement an interface and improve it through a three-stage study with 24 participants. The study shows how sketches convey motion with minimal input, how their inherent ambiguity requires users to be involved for clarification, and how sketches can visually guide video refinement.

To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols.

We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric.",

We introduce Growing Policy Optimization (GPO), a training framework that applies a time-varying action transformation to restrict the effective action space in the early stage, thereby encouraging more effective data collection and policy learning, and then progressively expands it to enhance exploration and achieve higher expected return. We prove that this transformation preserves the PPO update rule and introduces only bounded, vanishing gradient distortion, thereby ensuring stable training. We evaluate GPO on both quadruped and hexapod robots, including zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on hardware. Policies trained with GPO consistently achieve better performance.

We test the ability of LLMs to interact accurately with large structured datasets for analytics and the reliability of LLMs in extracting semantically correct information from free text health records when supported by RAG. To this end, we presented a flexible evaluation framework that automatically generates synthetic question and answer pairs tailored to the characteristics of each dataset or task. Experiments were conducted on a curated subset of MIMIC III, (four structured tables and one clinical note type), using a mix of locally hosted and API-based LLMs. Evaluation combined exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment.

Reverse engineering continues to threaten software security, while traditional virtual machine protection (VMP) relies on rigid, rule-based transformations that are costly to design and vulnerable to automated analysis. In this work, we present the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our approach builds large-scale paired datasets of source code and normalized VM implementations, and introduces hierarchical dependency modeling at intra-, preceding-, and inter-instruction levels. We jointly optimize language modeling with functionality-aware and protection-aware contrastive objectives to capture both semantic equivalence and protection strength. To further assess resilience, we propose a protection effectiveness optimization task that quantifies and ranks different VM variants derived from the same source. Coupled with a two-stage continual pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, our method enables models to generate, compare, and reason over protected code. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves robustness across diverse protection levels, opening a new research direction for learning-based software defense. In this work, we present ShieldedCode, the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our method achieves 26.95% Pass@1 on L0 VM code generation compared to 22.58% for GPT-4o., and improves binary similarity detection Recall@1 by 10% over state of art methods like jTrans.",

However, most practical pipelines stop at supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and fail to reach the reinforcement learning (RL) alignment stage. The main reason is that RL alignment typically requires either expensive human preference annotation or heavy reliance on high-quality reward models with large-scale API usage and ongoing engineering maintenance, both of which are ill-suited to on-premise settings. To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistently strong performance under a low-cost setting.",

We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations. Experiments on both user-generated and AI-generated IQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong MOS-aligned correlations, making lightweight IQA practical under limited annotation budgets.",

These processes demand large on-chip SRAM and involve irregular memory accesses that conventional NPUs struggle to handle efficiently.

Together, these optimizations deliver up to a 2.53x speedup over the NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU under an equivalent nm technology node.

We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized \"unmarked\" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.",

        "abstract": "Family learning takes place in everyday routines where children and caregivers read, practice, and develop new skills together. Despite growing interest in AI tutors, most existing systems are designed for single learners or classroom settings and do not address the distributed planning, coordination, and execution demands of learning at home. This paper introduces ParPal, a human-centred, LLM-powered system that supports multi-actor family learning by decomposing learning goals into actionable subtasks, allocating them across caregivers under realistic availability and expertise constraints, and providing caregiver-in-the-loop tutoring support with visibility into individual and collective contributions. Through expert evaluation of generated weekly learning plans and a one-week field deployment with 11 families, we identify systematic failure modes in current LLM-based planning, including misalignment with role expertise, unnecessary or costly collaboration, missing pedagogical learning trajectories, and physically or temporally infeasible tasks. While ParPal improves coordination clarity and recognition of caregiving effort, these findings expose fundamental limitations in how current LLMs operationalize pedagogical knowledge, reason about collaboration, and account for real-world, embodied constraints. We discuss implications for human-centred AI design and AI methodology, positioning multi-actor family learning as a critical testbed for advancing planning, adaptation, and pedagogical structure in next-generation AI systems.",

        "abstract": "\"Compression Tells Intelligence\", is supported by research in artificial intelligence, particularly concerning (multimodal) large language models (LLMs/MLLMs), where compression efficiency often correlates with improved model performance and capabilities. For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.",

However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models. These results indicate that Hessian-guided relaxation effectively recovers representational capacity, establishing a more robust training path for 1.58-bit LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/hestia2026/Hestia.",

Drawing on domestication theory and emerging frameworks for AI literacy, we demonstrate that functional AI competence emerges through ongoing relational negotiation rather than one-time adoption. Students develop sophisticated genre portfolios, strategically matching interaction patterns to learning needs while exercising critical judgment about AI limitations. Notably, repair work during AI breakdowns produces substantial learning about AI capabilities, developing what we term \"repair literacy\" -- a crucial but underexplored dimension of AI competence.

This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

Even basic questions -- is this workload memory-bound or compute-bound? -- often remain unanswered. To close this gap, we develop a fine-grained, non-intrusive profiling framework for modern LLM inference engines, exemplified by http://llama.cpp but applicable to similar runtime architectures. Built on extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology, our system dynamically attaches probes to runtime functions across multiple layers -- without modifying or recompiling the source. It transforms collected traces into rich visualizations of operators, graphs, timelines, and hardware counter trends, exposing how dense inference, Mixture-of-Experts routing, and operator offloading behave in practice. With less than 4% runtime overhead and high profiling fidelity, our framework makes LLM inference both transparent and diagnosable, turning performance profiling into a practical tool for optimization, scheduling, and resource-aware deployment.",

In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.",

While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.",

This assumption is not true in most practical settings and there have been studies done in the past to challenge this notion. This work has been inspired by such studies and explores one of the ways to deal with heterogeneity in worker preferences - by clustering workers with similar preferences and personalising reward models for each cluster. This work provides an algorithm that encourages simultaneous learning of reward models and worker embeddings. This algorithm is then empirically tested against the Reddit TL;DR dataset with unique worker IDs. We have shown that clustering users into different groups based on their preferences and created personalised reward models improves win-rate of the said models.

In this paper, a generic model, Agentic Fog (AF), is presented, in which fog nodes are represented as policy-driven autonomous agents that communicate via p2p interactions based on shared memory and localized coordination. The suggested architecture decomposes a system's goals into abstract policy guidance and formalizes decentralized fog coordination as an exact potential game. The framework is guaranteed to converge and remain stable under asynchronous updates, bounded-rational best-response dynamics, and node failures. Simulations demonstrate that the AF system achieves lower average latency and adapts more efficiently to varying demand than greedy heuristics and integer linear programming under dynamic conditions.

Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4). We also introduce an explicit gradient-based corrective penalty that cancels the covariance induced bias within each update. We prove that buffer partitioning preserves the lower bound property of the maximization objective, and that these constraints mitigate excessive conservatism in extreme OOD areas without altering the core behavior of policy constrained offline reinforcement learning. Empirically, our method showcases higher stability and up to 30% improvement in returns over prior methods, especially with small datasets and splits that emphasize OOD areas.",

By explicitly characterizing residuals from observation and calibration models, the system establishes a task-space error budget from recorded warm-ups. The uncertainty budget yields a lateral closed-loop accuracy of approx. 49 micrometers at 95% confidence (worst-case testing subset) and a depth accuracy of <= 291 micrometers at 95% confidence bound during large in-plane moves. In a within-subject user study (N=8), the learned agent reduces overall NASA-TLX workload by 77.1% relative to the simple steady-hand assistance baseline.

We present Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA), an efficient method for training coding agents that enables the rapid and cheap creation of agents specialized to private codebases. Using only supervised finetuning (SFT), SERA achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open-source (open data, method, code) models while matching the performance of frontier open-weight models like Devstral-Small-2. Creating SERA models is 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods to reach equivalent performance. Our method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from a single code repository. Combined with cost-efficiency, this enables specialization to private codebases. Beyond repository specialization, we apply SVG to a larger corpus of codebases, generating over 200,000 synthetic trajectories. We use this dataset to provide detailed analysis of scaling laws, ablations, and confounding factors for training coding agents. Overall, we believe our work will greatly accelerate research on open coding agents and showcase the advantage of open-source models that can specialize to private codebases.

We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.\nBased on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule. We further propose a video-level fairness evaluation protocol combining VideoLLM-based reasoning with human verification.

Motivated by this phenomenon, we ask: how do transformers learn to associate information across modalities from in-context examples? We investigate this question through controlled experiments on small transformers trained on synthetic classification tasks, enabling precise manipulation of data statistics and model architecture. We begin by revisiting core principles of unimodal ICL in modern transformers. While several prior findings replicate, we find that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) increases the data complexity threshold for ICL. Extending to the multimodal setting reveals a fundamental learning asymmetry: when pretrained on high-diversity data from a primary modality, surprisingly low data complexity in the secondary modality suffices for multimodal ICL to emerge. Mechanistic analysis shows that both settings rely on an induction-style mechanism that copies labels from matching in-context exemplars; multimodal training refines and extends these circuits across modalities. Our findings provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding multimodal ICL in modern transformers and introduce a controlled testbed for future investigation.",

Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.",

We show that this method results in complementary word choices and sentence structures when compared to LLM-generated examples. When these strategies are combined, the resulting hybrid system achieves a more holistic picture of the relations of interest than either method alone. Our framework transfers well across datasets (FS-TACRED and FS-FewRel) and LLM families (Qwen and Gemma).

We propose Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) for semantic representation and fine-grained retrieval of code and text. Our approach enhances retrieval precision through tree pruning and mitigates hallucinations via a re-ranking mechanism that integrates non-RAG solutions. Structuring external data into finer-grained nodes improves retrieval granularity. Evaluations on HumanEval and MBPP show up to 20% pass@1 accuracy gains and a 34% improvement over baselines on MBPP. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed PKG approach along with re-ranker effectively address complex problems while maintaining minimal negative impact on solutions that are already correct without RAG.

We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.",

We evaluate with training two types of \\mu, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on \\mu-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that \\mu-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by \\mu, noting the superior performance of \\mu augmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.",

However, existing systems largely rely on runtime-centric execution paradigms, repeatedly reading, summarizing, and reasoning over large volumes of scientific literature online. This on-the-spot computation strategy incurs high computational cost, suffers from context window limitations, and often leads to brittle reasoning and hallucination. We propose Idea2Story, a pre-computation-driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from online reasoning to offline knowledge construction. Idea2Story continuously collects peer-reviewed papers together with their review feedback, extracts core methodological units, composes reusable research patterns, and organizes them into a structured methodological knowledge graph. At runtime, underspecified user research intents are aligned to established research paradigms, enabling efficient retrieval and reuse of high-quality research patterns instead of open-ended generation and trial-and-error. By grounding research planning and execution in a pre-built knowledge graph, Idea2Story alleviates the context window bottleneck of LLMs and substantially reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature. We conduct qualitative analyses and preliminary empirical studies demonstrating that Idea2Story can generate coherent, methodologically grounded, and novel research patterns, and can produce several high-quality research demonstrations in an end-to-end setting. These results suggest that offline knowledge construction provides a practical and scalable foundation for reliable autonomous scientific discovery.",

The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as \"sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., \"increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.",

Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the \"Big Two\" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for \"agency\" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for \"communion.\" This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.",

Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks.

We employ a variational autoencoder to jointly learn self-supervised feature representations for style transfer and generate weakly paired source-target trajectories to improve physical realism of synthesised trajectories. We demonstrate the application of our approach based on the case study of robot cutting of unknown materials. Compared to baseline methods, including our previous work, CycleGAN, and conditional variational autoencoder-based time series translation, our approach achieves improved task completion time and behavioural stability with minimal real-world data.

By inheriting the streamlined design of PyCIL, C3Box provides a JSON-based configuration and standardized execution pipeline. This design enables reproducible experimentation with low engineering overhead and makes C3Box a reliable benchmark platform for continual learning research.

We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement.

Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.",

        "abstract": "Transformer-based architectures are the most used architectures in many deep learning fields like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision or Speech processing. It may encourage the direct use of Transformers in the constrained tasks, without questioning whether it will yield the same benefits as in standard tasks.  Given specific constraints, it is essential to evaluate the relevance of transformer models. This work questions the suitability of transformers for specific domains. We argue that the high computational requirements and latency issues associated with these models do not align well with streaming applications. Our study promotes the search for alternative strategies to improve efficiency without sacrificing performance.  In light of this observation, our paper critically examines the usefulness of transformer architecture in such constrained environments. As a first attempt, we show that the computational cost for Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) can be reduced using deformable convolution instead of Self-Attention. Furthermore, we show that Self-Attention mechanisms can be entirely removed and not replaced, without observing significant degradation in the Word Error Rate.",

Given a target entropy vector, our algorithm searches for a graph realization whose min-cut entropies match the target vector. If the target vector does not admit such a graph realization, it must lie outside the cone, in which case the algorithm finds a graph whose corresponding entropy vector most nearly approximates the target and allows us to probe the location of the facets. For the $\\sf N=3$ cone, we confirm that our algorithm successfully rediscovers monogamy of mutual information beginning with a target vector outside the holographic entropy cone. We then apply the algorithm to the $\\sf N=6$ cone, analyzing the 6 \"mystery\" extreme rays of the subadditivity cone from https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15364 that satisfy all known holographic entropy inequalities yet lacked graph realizations. We found realizations for 3 of them, proving they are genuine extreme rays of the holographic entropy cone, while providing evidence that the remaining 3 are not realizable, implying unknown holographic inequalities exist for $\\sf N=6$.",

        "abstract": "Transient noise artifacts, or glitches, fundamentally limit the sensitivity of gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers and can mimic true astrophysical signals, particularly the short-duration intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers. Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck,\" requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors.",

An XDL model based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to identify and percolate high-importance structures for the evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy budget terms of a turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of $Re_\\tau = 125$. The results show that the important structures are predominantly located in the near-wall region and are more frequently associated with sweep-type events. In the viscous layer, the SHAP structures relevant for production and viscous diffusion are almost entirely contained within those relevant for dissipation, revealing a clear hierarchical organization of near-wall turbulence. In the outer layer, this hierarchical organization breaks down and only velocity-pressure-gradient correlation and turbulent transport SHAP structures remain, with a moderate spatial coincidence of approximately $60\\%$. Finally, we show that none of the coherent structures classically studied in turbulence are capable of representing the mechanisms behind the various terms of the turbulent kinetic energy budget throughout the channel. These results reveal dissipation as the dominant organizing mechanism of near-wall turbulence, constraining production and viscous diffusion within a single structural hierarchy that breaks down in the outer layer.",

We cast benchmarking as finite-population inference and, under a fixed query budget, seek tight confidence intervals (CIs) for model accuracy with valid frequentist coverage. We propose Factorized Active Querying (FAQ), which (a) leverages historical information through a Bayesian factor model; (b) adaptively selects questions using a hybrid variance-reduction/active-learning sampling policy; and (c) maintains validity through Proactive Active Inference -- a finite-population extension of active inference (Zrnic & Candes, 2024) that enables direct question selection while preserving coverage. With negligible overhead cost, FAQ delivers up to $5\\times$ effective sample size gains over strong baselines on two benchmark suites, across varying historical-data missingness levels: this means that it matches the CI width of uniform sampling while using up to $5\\times$ fewer queries.
