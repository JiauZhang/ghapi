        "abstract": "We present a systematic study of multimodal emotion recognition using the EAV dataset, investigating whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets. We implement three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Our experiments show that sophisticated attention mechanisms consistently underperform on small datasets. M2 models achieved 5 to 13 percentage points below baselines due to overfitting and destruction of pretrained features. In contrast, simple domain-appropriate modifications proved effective: adding delta MFCCs to the audio CNN improved accuracy from 61.9\\% to \\textbf{65.56\\%} (+3.66pp), while frequency-domain features for EEG achieved \\textbf{67.62\\%} (+7.62pp over the paper baseline). Our vision transformer baseline (M1) reached \\textbf{75.30\\%}, exceeding the paper's ViViT result (74.5\\%) through domain-specific pretraining, and vision delta features achieved \\textbf{72.68\\%} (+1.28pp over the paper CNN). These findings demonstrate that for small-scale emotion recognition, domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity.",

However, transferability to aerial imagery remains unexplored. We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck. Prompt engineering strategies such as domain-specific prefixing and synonym expansion, fail to provide meaningful performance gains. Performance varies dramatically across datasets (F1: 0.53 on DIOR, 0.12 on FAIR1M), exposing brittleness to imaging conditions. These findings establish baseline expectations and highlight the need for domain-adaptive approaches in aerial OVD.",

Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language.

However, existing detection mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with rapid variant evolution and sophisticated obfuscation techniques that camouflage malicious intent. Furthermore, many current defenses suffer from high false-alarm rates when encountering benign administrative scripts that employ heavy obfuscation for intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we present ShellForge, an adversarial co-evolution framework that couples automated webshell generation with multi-view detection to continuously harden defensive boundaries. The framework operates through an iterative co-training loop where a generator and a detector mutually reinforce each other via the exchange of hard samples. The generator is optimized through supervised fine-tuning and preference-based reinforcement learning to synthesize functional, highly evasive variants. Simultaneously, we develop a multi-view fusion detector that integrates semantic features from long-string compression, structural features from pruned abstract syntax trees, and global statistical indicators such as Shannon entropy. To minimize false positives, ShellForge utilizes a LLM-based transformation to create de-malicious samples--scripts that retain complex obfuscation patterns but lack harmful payloads--serving as high-quality hard negatives during training. Evaluations on the public FWOID benchmark demonstrate that ShellForge significantly enhances defensive robustness. Upon convergence, the detector maintains a 0.981 F1-score while the generator achieves a 0.939 evasion rate against commercial engines on VirusTotal.",

This work studies Large Language Models (LLMs) as players in tacit coordination games, and addresses how, when, and why focal points emerge.

The highly distributed and interdependent nature of modern cloud-based systems often complicates RCA efforts, particularly for multi-hop fault propagation, where symptoms appear far from their true causes. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance automated RCA. However, their practical value for RCA depends on the fidelity of reasoning and decision-making. Existing work relies on historical incident corpora, operates directly on high-volume telemetry beyond current LLM capacity, or embeds reasoning inside complex multi-agent pipelines -- conditions that obscure whether failures arise from reasoning itself or from peripheral design choices.\nWe present a focused empirical evaluation that isolates an LLM's reasoning behavior. We design a controlled experimental framework that foregrounds the LLM by using a simplified experimental setting. We evaluate six LLMs under two agentic workflows (ReAct and Plan-and-Execute) and a non-agentic baseline on two real-world case studies (GAIA and OpenRCA). In total, we executed 48,000 simulated failure scenarios, totaling 228 days of execution time. We measure both root-cause accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning traces. We produce a labeled taxonomy of 16 common RCA reasoning failures and use an LLM-as-a-Judge for annotation. Our results clarify where current open-source LLMs succeed and fail in multi-hop RCA, quantify sensitivity to input data modalities, and identify reasoning failures that predict final correctness. Together, these contributions provide transparent and reproducible empirical results and a failure taxonomy to guide future work on reasoning-driven system diagnosis.",

To improve efficiency, we train the value network directly in the latent space, avoiding repeated solver calls during policy optimization. To address the piecewise-constant and discontinuous value landscape induced by solver-based action selection, we introduce a smoothed Bellman operator that yields stable, well-defined learning targets.

As both offensive and defensive prompt injection techniques evolve quickly, a structured understanding of mitigation strategies becomes increasingly important. To address that, this work presents the first systematic literature review on prompt injection mitigation strategies, comprehending 88 studies. Building upon NIST's report on adversarial machine learning, this work contributes to the field through several avenues. First, it identifies studies beyond those documented in NIST's report and other academic reviews and surveys. Second, we propose an extension to NIST taxonomy by introducing additional categories of defenses. Third, by adopting NIST's established terminology and taxonomy as a foundation, we promote consistency and enable future researchers to build upon the standardized taxonomy proposed in this work. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of the reviewed prompt injection defenses, documenting their reported quantitative effectiveness across specific LLMs and attack datasets, while also indicating which solutions are open-source and model-agnostic. This catalog, together with the guidelines presented herein, aims to serve as a practical resource for researchers advancing the field of adversarial machine learning and for developers seeking to implement effective defenses in production systems.",

In practice, two main approaches are commonly adopted: (i) supervised or imitation learning, which requires comprehensive naturalistic driving data capturing all states that influence a vehicle's decisions and corresponding actions, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL), where the simulated driving environment either matches or is intentionally more challenging than real-world conditions. Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide. Such constrained and regularized policies promote realistic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers at scale.",

Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions.",

Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini. Furthermore, FunPRM produces code that is more readable and reusable for developers.",

It scrutinizes the pervasive narratives that are shaping the societal engagement with AI, spotlighting key themes such as agency and decision-making, autonomy, truthfulness, knowledge processing, prediction, general purpose, neutrality and objectivity, apolitical optimization, sustainability game-changer, democratization, mass unemployment, and the dualistic portrayal of AI as either a harbinger of societal utopia or dystopia. Those narratives are analysed critically based on insights from critical computer science, critical data and algorithm studies, from STS, data protection theory, as well as from the philosophy of mind and semiotics. To properly analyse the narratives presented, the article first delves into a historical and technical contextualisation of the AI discourse itself. The article then introduces the notion of \"Zeitgeist AI\" to critique the imprecise and misleading application of the term \"AI\" across various societal sectors. Then, by discussing common narratives with nuance, the article contextualises and challenges often assumed socio-political implications of AI, uncovering in detail and with examples the inherent political, power infused and value-laden decisions within all AI applications. Concluding with a call for a more grounded engagement with AI, the article carves out acute problems ignored by the narratives discussed and proposes new narratives recognizing AI as a human-directed tool necessarily subject to societal governance.",

This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning. Second, it enables an interpretable use of otherwise redundant rotational degrees of freedom, selectively amplifying semantically meaningful token classes within individual attention heads.

We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.\nConceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.\nTo overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths.

Accordingly, we propose VMonarch, a novel attention mechanism for Video DiTs that enables efficient computation over the dynamic sparse patterns with structured Monarch matrices. First, we adapt spatio-temporal Monarch factorization to explicitly capture the intra-frame and inter-frame correlations of the video data. Second, we introduce a recomputation strategy to mitigate artifacts arising from instabilities during alternating minimization of Monarch matrices. Third, we propose a novel online entropy algorithm fused into FlashAttention, enabling fast Monarch matrix updates for long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMonarch achieves comparable or superior generation quality to full attention on VBench after minimal tuning. It overcomes the attention bottleneck in Video DiTs, reduces attention FLOPs by a factor of 17.5, and achieves a speedup of over 5x in attention computation for long videos, surpassing state-of-the-art sparse attention methods at 90% sparsity.",

To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics.

The combination of kinematic, geometric and physics constraints underlying this domain results in challenging nonmonotone problem instances which demand breaking each manipulation action into multiple parts to achieve a desired object rearrangement. Prior work tackles such instances by planning prerelocations, temporary object displacements that enable constraint satisfaction, but deciding where to prerelocate remains difficult due to local minima leading to infeasible or high-cost paths. Our key insight is that these minima can be avoided by steering a prerelocation optimization toward low-cost regions informed by Dubins path classification. These optimized prerelocations are integrated into an object traversability graph that encodes kinematic, geometric, and pushing constraints. Searching this graph in a depth-first fashion results in efficient, feasible rearrangement sequences. Across a series of densely cluttered scenarios with up to 13 objects, our framework, ReloPush-BOSS, exhibits consistently highest success rates and shortest pushing paths compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Hardware experiments on a 1/10 car-like pusher demonstrate the robustness of our approach. Code and footage from our experiments can be found at: https://fluentrobotics.com/relopushboss.",

We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%.

We study how reward function design influences resilience in mixed-motive settings and introduce a novel framework that learns reward functions from ranked trajectories, guided by a cooperative resilience metric. Agents are trained in a suite of social dilemma environments using three reward strategies: i) traditional individual reward; ii) resilience-inferred reward; and iii) hybrid that balance both. We explore three reward parameterizations-linear models, hand-crafted features, and neural networks, and employ two preference-based learning algorithms to infer rewards from behavioral rankings. Our results demonstrate that hybrid strategy significantly improve robustness under disruptions without degrading task performance and reduce catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse.

However, current RLVR methods typically train LLMs to solve problems in isolation, without explicitly preparing them to synthesize and benefit from different rationales that arise during debate. In this work, we propose Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning (SDRL), a training framework that equips a single LLM with strong standalone problem-solving ability and the capability to learn from diverse reasoning trajectories in MAD. Given a prompt, SDRL first samples multiple candidate solutions, then constructs a debate context with diverse reasoning paths and generates second-turn responses conditioned on this context. Finally, SDRL jointly optimizes both the initial and debate-conditioned responses, yielding a model that is effective as both a standalone solver and a debate participant. Experiments across multiple base models and reasoning benchmarks show that SDRL improves overall MAD performance while simultaneously strengthening single model reasoning.",

From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning.

We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity.

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Many real-world optimization problems involve an expensive ground-truth oracle (e.g., human evaluation, physical experiments) and a cheap, low-fidelity prediction oracle (e.g., machine learning models, simulations). Meanwhile, abundant offline data (e.g., past experiments and predictions) are often available and can be used to pretrain powerful predictive models, as well as to provide an informative prior. We propose Prediction-Augmented Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (PA-GP-UCB), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both oracles and offline data to achieve provable gains in sample efficiency for the ground-truth oracle queries. PA-GP-UCB employs a control-variates estimator derived from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct prediction bias and reduce uncertainty. We prove that PA-GP-UCB preserves the standard regret rate of GP-UCB while achieving a strictly smaller leading constant that is explicitly controlled by prediction quality and offline data coverage. Empirically, PA-GP-UCB converges faster than Vanilla GP-UCB and naive prediction-augmented GP-UCB baselines on synthetic benchmarks and on a real-world hypothesis evaluation task grounded in human behavioral data, where predictions are provided by large language models. These results establish PA-GP-UCB as a general and sample-efficient framework for hypothesis generation under expensive feedback.",

Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.",

In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions.

By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, most existing routers treat this as a fixed choice among a small set of models, which makes them hard to adapt to new models or changing budget constraints. In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost. Experiments show that SCOPE is more than just a cost-saving tool. It flexibly adapts to user needs: it can boost accuracy by up to 25.7% when performance is the priority, or cut costs by up to 95.1% when efficiency matters most.",

While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints. On two additional externally validated tasks, AgentScore achieves higher discrimination than established guideline-based scores.",

If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate \"thinking\" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.",

To tackle these challenges simultaneously, this work integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that unifies carbon footprint reduction, inventory management, and cryptographic-like security measures. We design a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that couples a controllable spin-chain analogy with real-time AIoT signals and optimizes a multi-objective reward unifying fidelity, security, and carbon costs. The approach learns robust policies with stabilized training via value-based and ensemble updates, supported by window-normalized reward components to ensure commensurate scaling. In simulation, the method exhibits smooth convergence, strong late-episode performance, and graceful degradation under representative noise channels, outperforming standard learned and model-based references, highlighting its robust handling of real-time sustainability and risk demands. These findings reinforce the potential for quantum-inspired AIoT frameworks to drive secure, eco-conscious supply chain operations at scale, laying the groundwork for globally connected infrastructures that responsibly meet both consumer and environmental needs.",

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.",

Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \\emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process. Instead, we propose that LLMs function like a Swiss Army knife: depending on task structure, the LLM dynamically selects between strategies, only some of which yield representational straightening.",

Rather than directly prompting LLMs to solve the conjecture, we task them with generating rule-constrained geometric lemmas implemented as executable code. These lemmas are then used to construct a collection of specialized functions, which we call verification functions, that yield theoretically certified lower bounds of the Steiner ratio. Through progressive lemma refinement driven by reflection, the system establishes a new certified lower bound of 0.8559 for the Steiner ratio. The entire research effort involves only thousands of LLM calls, demonstrating the strong potential of LLM-based systems for advanced mathematical research.",

These protocols allow multiple agents to coordinate to come to a common agreement in an environment with uncertainty and failures. We formulate protocol design as a search problem over strategies in a game with imperfect information, and the desired correctness conditions are specified in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). However, standard methods for solving multi-agent games fail to learn correct protocols in this setting, even when the number of agents is small. We propose a learning framework, GGMS, which integrates a specialized variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search with a transformer-based action encoder, a global depth-first search to break out of local minima, and repeated feedback from a model checker. Protocols output by GGMS are verified correct via exhaustive model checking for all executions within the bounded setting. We further prove that, under mild assumptions, the search process is complete: if a correct protocol exists, GGMS will eventually find it. In experiments, we show that GGMS can learn correct protocols for larger settings than existing methods.",

We find that higher accuracy does not guarantee prompt stability, and that models can appear well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. We propose a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that jointly targets accuracy and stability, showing that explicitly including a stability term reduces flip rates across tasks and models, sometimes at modest accuracy cost.

We introduce our method, SP2DPO (Semantic Per-Pair DPO), a generalization that replaces the global temperature with an instance-specific schedule beta_i pre-decided offline from structured semantic-gap annotations (category, magnitude, confidence) produced by teacher language models. We instantiate this procedure on the UltraFeedback preference corpus (59,960 pairs), enabling large-scale construction of an auditable beta_i artifact, and incur zero training-time overhead: the inner-loop optimizer remains standard DPO with beta set per pair. We focus our empirical study on AlpacaEval 2.0, reporting both raw win rate and length-controlled win rate. Across four open-weight, instruction-tuned student backbones (4B-8B), SP2DPO is competitive with a tuned global-beta DPO baseline and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 length-controlled win rate on two of four backbones, while avoiding per-model beta sweeps.

To further increase attack success rates (ASR), we propose a ReAct-driven adaptive noising mechanism that iteratively perturbs input images based on model feedback. This approach leverages the ReAct paradigm to refine adversarial noise in regions most likely to activate safety defenses, thereby enhancing stealth and evasion.

This results in a ''Structure Gap'', where models trained on shallow reasoning chains fail to extrapolate to deeper recursive steps. In this work, we introduce Bifocal Attention, an architectural paradigm that decouples positional encoding into two distinct modalities: Geometric Eyes (Standard RoPE) for precise token-level manipulation, and Spectral Eyes (Learnable Harmonic Operators) for tracking long-range recursive depth. We propose a novel training protocol, Spectral Evolution, which initializes positional frequencies as static geometric parameters but allows them to evolve via gradient descent into a harmonic basis optimized for the specific algorithmic topology of the task.",

As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size.

Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes.

Instead of estimating advantages, we bifurcate $K$ outcomes into positive and negative sets, then maximize the likelihood of positive outcomes.

Using controlled causal interventions on both raw and condensed forms of experience, we comprehensively evaluate four representative frameworks across 10 LLM backbones and 9 environments. Our analysis uncovers a striking asymmetry: while agents consistently depend on raw experience, they often disregard or misinterpret condensed experience, even when it is the only experience provided. This gap persists across single- and multi-agent configurations and across backbone scales. We trace its underlying causes to three factors: the semantic limitations of condensed content, internal processing biases that suppress experience, and task regimes where pretrained priors already suffice. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about self-evolving methods and underscore the need for more faithful and reliable approaches to experience integration.",

Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal. These results provide a principled justification on when weak diffusion priors can be used reliably.",

As forecasting is probabilistic, developing and evaluating AI forecasters requires generating large numbers of diverse and difficult questions, and accurately resolving them. Previous efforts to automate this laborious work relied on recurring data sources (e.g., weather, stocks), limiting diversity and utility. In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform. We also find that our system resolves questions at approximately 95% accuracy. We verify that forecasting agents powered by more intelligent LLMs perform better on these questions (Brier score of 0.134 for Gemini 3 Pro, 0.149 for GPT-5, and 0.179 for Gemini 2.5 Flash). Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be leveraged to directly improve forecasting, by evaluating a question decomposition strategy on a generated question set, yielding a significant improvement in Brier scores (0.132 vs. 0.141).",

This study addresses that critical gap by processing 5MP camera imagery using a novel, advanced frame-to-frame calibration and stereo matching methodology designed to achieve both high accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to evaluate real-time performance by comparing real-time disparity maps with ground-truth disparity maps derived from more computationally intensive stereo matching algorithms.

        "abstract": "RLVR is now a standard way to train LLMs on reasoning tasks with verifiable outcomes, but when rollout generation dominates the cost, efficiency depends heavily on which prompts you sample and when. In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe performance gains peaking at $8.8\\%$ and $5.8\\%$, respectively, on 8B-parameter models, confirming the scalability and effectiveness of our framework in large-scale masked diffusion language model regimes.",

Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods. This result highlights a novel path towards mitigating hallucination by unlocking the inherent potential within LVLMs themselves.",

These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.",

We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles.

Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity.

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics. Specifically, we conducted extensive experiments across multiple model families and diverse task domains to establish the existence of the latent learning dynamics in LLMs.",

In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%.",

With the scaling of technology nodes, in floorplanning stage especially 3D scenarios with multiple stacked layers, it has become increasingly challenging to adhere to complex hardware design rules. Current methods are only capable of handling specific and limited design rules, while violations of other rules require manual and meticulous adjustment. This leads to labor-intensive and time-consuming post-processing for expert engineers. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one deep reinforcement learning-based approach to tackle these challenges, and design novel representations for real-world IC design rules that have not been addressed by previous approaches. Specifically, the processing of various hardware design rules is unified into a single framework with three key components: 1) novel matrix representations to model the design rules, 2) constraints on the action space to filter out invalid actions that cause rule violations, and 3) quantitative analysis of constraint satisfaction as reward signals. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our approach. Furthermore, transferability is well demonstrated on unseen circuits. Our framework is extensible to accommodate new design rules, thus providing flexibility to address emerging challenges in future chip design.

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was designed to improve reasoning, but in fact it worsens this situation through two failure modes: diversity collapse, where training amplifies a single solution strategy while ignoring alternatives of gradient signal, and gradient diminishing, where a large portion of questions yield zero gradients because all rollouts receive identical rewards. We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent Pass@k improvements, with gains up to 9.84 points on competition math (AMC12, AIME24) and 5.05 points on out-of-distribution scientific reasoning (GPQA-Diamond).",

The fused signals produce a reliable Visual Cropping Guidance Map, which highlights the most task-relevant region and guides the cropping of a subimage subsequently provided to the MLLM together with the image-question pair.

Specifically, FraudShield constructs and refines a fraud tactic-keyword knowledge graph to capture high-confidence associations between suspicious text and fraud techniques. The structured knowledge graph augments the original input by highlighting keywords and providing supporting evidence, guiding the LLM toward more secure responses.

Current approaches usually rely on training families of model variants or model distillation, which requires additional training and supports only a pre-selected set of sizes rather than fine-grained adaptation at runtime. In this paper, we propose Elastic Spectral State Space Models (ES-SSM), which require only one-time training at full capacity, but can be directly truncated into arbitrary scales for budgeted, runtime inference without retraining. Our ES-SSM builds on Hankel spectral filtering over a state space model (SSM), coupled with a lightweight input-adaptive gate trained under randomized spectral budgets. Using a shared masked normalization rule over the ordered spectral channels, we encourage predictive capability to concentrate in low-index components, while higher-index components act primarily as refinement. We test our algorithm across long-sequence benchmarks spanning text, logic, retrieval, vision, and audio. We demonstrate that a single ES-SSM model trained once can be truncated to provide competitive performance compared with modern Transformer and SSM baselines at similar parameter scales. Furthermore, by testing under various runtime budgets, we observe smooth and stable budget-performance curves over a wide range of truncation levels.",

We theoretically demonstrate that SSL preserves optimal solution ordering and enhances the gradient signal-to-noise ratio, thereby fostering more directed optimization. Extensive experiments across GUI perception, short/long-term planning, and complex reasoning tasks show consistent improvements over strong baselines on 12 benchmarks, achieving up to 2.5X sample efficiency gains and effective cross-task transferability.

In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning. Our results position GFT as a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative for scalable adaptation of flow matching models under distribution shift.",

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations.

In this paper, we propose MirrorTalk, a generative framework based on a conditional diffusion model, combined with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) that can distill pure style representations from a brief reference video. To effectively utilize this representation, we further introduce a hierarchical modulation strategy within the diffusion process.

Technically, multi-scale features of the reference subject are first extracted by a visual tokenizer. Instead of interleaving these conditional features with target image tokens across scales, our DreamVAR pre-fills the full subject feature sequence prior to predicting target image tokens. This design simplifies autoregressive dependencies and mitigates the train-test discrepancy in multi-scale conditioning scenario within the VAR paradigm. DreamVAR further incorporates reinforcement learning to jointly enhance semantic alignment and subject consistency.

In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment.",

We address these challenges with SYNTHAGENT, a framework that jointly synthesizes diverse tool-use training data and simulates complete environments. Specifically, a strong teacher model creates novel tasks and tool ecosystems, then rewrites them into intentionally underspecified instructions. This compels agents to actively query users for missing details. When handling synthetic tasks, an LLM-based user simulator provides user-private information, while a mock tool system delivers stable tool responses. For rewards, task-level rubrics are constructed based on required subgoals, user-agent interactions, and forbidden behaviors.

We propose RoboStriker, a hierarchical three-stage framework that enables fully autonomous humanoid boxing by decoupling high-level strategic reasoning from low-level physical execution. The framework first learns a comprehensive repertoire of boxing skills by training a single-agent motion tracker on human motion capture data. These skills are subsequently distilled into a structured latent manifold, regularized by projecting the Gaussian-parameterized distribution onto a unit hypersphere. This topological constraint effectively confines exploration to the subspace of physically plausible motions. In the final stage, we introduce Latent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP), where competing agents learn competitive tactics by interacting within the latent action space rather than the raw motor space, significantly stabilizing multi-agent training. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboStriker achieves superior competitive performance in simulation and exhibits sim-to-real transfer. Our website is available at RoboStriker.",

In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one. This allows PMPO to dynamically transition between the aggressive arithmetic mean for reliable trajectories and the conservative geometric mean for unstable ones.

By bidirectional hierarchical reasoning, segment tokens are hierarchically pooled in the encoder and unpooled in the decoder to reverse the hierarchy. The model is supervised only at the final output, allowing the segment hierarchy to emerge without explicit segmentation supervision. SHED improves depth boundary sharpness and segment coherence, while demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization from synthetic to the real-world environments.

        "abstract": "A major challenge in training TableQA agents, compared to standard text- and image-based agents, is that answers cannot be inferred from a static input but must be reasoned through stepwise transformations of the table state, introducing multi-step reasoning complexity and environmental interaction. This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer. Consistent improvement pattern across various LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks further confirms RE-Tab's generalisability. The repository is available at https://github.com/ThomasK1018/RE_Tab .",

        "abstract": "Because of the pervasive use of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially in high-stakes domains, the interpretability of DNNs has received increased attention. The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \\emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \\textbf{REKD} (\\textbf{R}ationale \\textbf{E}xtraction with \\textbf{K}nowledge \\textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \\emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models.",

We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting. CraEG is training-free, single-pass, and compatible with standard sampling strategies.

Evolutionary Computation methods are generally advantaged in solving DOPs since they resemble dynamic biological evolution. However, existing evolutionary dynamic optimization methods rely heavily on human-crafted adaptive strategy to detect environment variation in DOPs, and then adapt the searching strategy accordingly. These hand-crafted strategies may perform ineffectively at out-of-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted approach to enable automated variation detection and self-adaption in evolutionary algorithms. This is achieved by borrowing the bi-level learning-to-optimize idea from recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization works. We use a deep Q-network as optimization dynamics detector and searching strategy adapter: It is fed as input with current-step optimization state and then dictates desired control parameters to underlying evolutionary algorithms for next-step optimization. The learning objective is to maximize the expected performance gain across a problem distribution. Once trained, our approach could generalize toward unseen DOPs with automated environment variation detection and self-adaption. To facilitate comprehensive validation, we further construct an easy-to-difficult DOPs testbed with diverse synthetic instances. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate flexible searching behavior and superior performance of our approach in solving DOPs, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "Real-time path planning in constrained environments remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous systems. Traditional classical planners, while effective under perfect perception assumptions, are often sensitive to real-world perception constraints and rely on online search procedures that incur high computational costs. In complex surroundings, this renders real-time deployment prohibitive. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for real-time path planning in parking scenarios. In particular, we focus on challenging scenes with tight spaces that require a high number of reversal maneuvers and adjustments. Unlike classical planners, our solution does not require ideal and structured perception, and in principle, could avoid the need for additional modules such as localization and tracking, resulting in a simpler and more practical implementation. Also, at test time, the policy generates actions through a single forward pass at each step, which is lightweight enough for real-time deployment. The task is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem grounded in a bicycle model dynamics, enabling the agent to directly learn navigation policies that respect vehicle kinematics and environmental constraints in the closed-loop setting. A new benchmark is developed to support both training and evaluation, capturing diverse and challenging scenarios. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art success rates and efficiency, surpassing classical planner baselines by +96% in success rate and +52% in efficiency. Furthermore, we release our benchmark as an open-source resource for the community to foster future research in autonomous systems.

However, there are few studies investigating the specific traits related to the powerful generation capacity of LLMs. This paper aims to delve into the generation characteristics exhibited by LLMs. Through our investigation, we have discovered that language models tend to capture target-side keywords at the beginning of the generation process. We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario. The results demonstrate that HOLO achieves comparable performance to the baselines in terms of both automatic and human-like evaluation metrics and highlight the potential of the Holographic Characteristic.",

However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of \"easy\" versus \"hard\" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.",

However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

This gap introduces uncertainty in planning and execution, particularly in domains like visual content generation (AIGC), where nuanced tool performance significantly impacts outcomes. To address this, we propose PerfGuard, a performance-aware agent framework for visual content generation that systematically models tool performance boundaries and integrates them into task planning and scheduling. Our framework introduces three core mechanisms: (1) Performance-Aware Selection Modeling (PASM), which replaces generic tool descriptions with a multi-dimensional scoring system based on fine-grained performance evaluations; (2) Adaptive Preference Update (APU), which dynamically optimizes tool selection by comparing theoretical rankings with actual execution rankings; and (3) Capability-Aligned Planning Optimization (CAPO), which guides the planner to generate subtasks aligned with performance-aware strategies. Experimental comparisons against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate PerfGuard's advantages in tool selection accuracy, execution reliability, and alignment with user intent, validating its robustness and practical utility for complex AIGC tasks.

As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model.",

In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SpanNorm, combined with a principled scaling strategy, maintains bounded signal variance throughout the network, preventing the gradient issues that plague PostNorm models, and also alleviating the representation collapse of PreNorm. Empirically, SpanNorm consistently outperforms standard normalization schemes in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and stable Transformer architectures.",

        "abstract": "Group-relative policy optimization methods train language models by generating multiple rollouts per prompt and normalizing rewards with a shared mean reward baseline. In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects. Although recent methods adopt causal techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization, they typically overlook temporal dynamics or depend on fixed confounder stratification. To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings.

In this work, we investigate whether smaller models can serve as efficient evaluators by leveraging internal representations instead of surface generation. We uncover a consistent empirical pattern: small LMs, despite with weak generative ability, encode rich evaluative signals in their hidden states. This motivates us to propose the Semantic Capacity Asymmetry Hypothesis: evaluation requires significantly less semantic capacity than generation and can be grounded in intermediate representations, suggesting that evaluation does not necessarily need to rely on large-scale generative models but can instead leverage latent features from smaller ones. Our findings motivate a paradigm shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Representation-as-a-Judge, a decoding-free evaluation strategy that probes internal model structure rather than relying on prompted output. We instantiate this paradigm through INSPECTOR, a probing-based framework that predicts aspect-level evaluation scores from small model representations. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, GPQA) show that INSPECTOR substantially outperforms prompting-based small LMs and closely approximates full LLM judges, while offering a more efficient, reliable, and interpretable alternative for scalable evaluation.",

While recent semantic-based parsers leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit superior generalizability over traditional syntax-based methods, their effectiveness is heavily contingent on model scale. This dependency leads to significant performance collapse when employing smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. Such degradation creates a major barrier to real-world adoption, where data privacy requirements and computational constraints necessitate the use of succinct models. To bridge this gap, we propose EFParser, an unsupervised LLM-based log parser designed to enhance the capabilities of smaller models through systematic architectural innovation. EFParser introduces a dual-cache system with an adaptive updating mechanism that distinguishes between novel patterns and variations of existing templates. This allows the parser to merge redundant templates and rectify prior errors, maintaining cache consistency. Furthermore, a dedicated correction module acts as a gatekeeper, validating and refining every LLM-generated template before caching to prevent error injection. Empirical evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that EFParser outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 12.5% across all metrics when running on smaller LLMs, even surpassing some baselines utilizing large-scale models. Despite its additional validation steps, EFParser maintains high computational efficiency, offering a robust and practical solution for real-world log analysis deployment.",

It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries.

We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance while training on only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks.",

Despite recent advances, existing methods continue to suffer from residual interference in complex acoustic scenes. This performance limitation stems largely from a data bottleneck: in-the-wild datasets contain weak labels and severe co-occurrence of events. These flaws induce models to learn spurious correlations between background noise and target categories instead of robust acoustic features. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline that eliminates co-occurrence of events by mining high-purity single-event segments from in-the-wild datasets via a semantically consistent synthesis protocol. Utilizing this pipeline, we constructed Hive, a high-quality synthetic dataset comprising 2.4k hours of raw audio. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art model SAM-Audio which was trained on a huge dataset $\\sim$500 times larger than Hive, certain open-source models trained on Hive achieve competitive separation accuracy and perceptual quality. Moreover, these models exhibited remarkable zero-shot generalization on out-of-distribution evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight that prioritizing purity of supervised signals enables significant data efficiency, offering a new paradigm for training robust auditory foundation models with reduced computational costs.

        "abstract": "Test-Time Training offers a promising way to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by adapting the model using only the test questions. However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving.

In this paper, we show that Diffusion-LMs, like diffusion models in image generation, exhibit a temporal division of labor: early denoising steps largely determine the global semantic structure, while later steps focus on local lexical refinement. Building on this insight, we propose Time-Annealed Perturbation Sampling (TAPS), a training-free inference strategy that encourages semantic branching early in the diffusion process while progressively reducing perturbations to preserve fluency and instruction adherence. TAPS is compatible with both non-autoregressive and semi-autoregressive Diffusion backbones, demonstrated on LLaDA and TraDo in our paper, and consistently improves output diversity across creative writing and reasoning benchmarks without compromising generation quality.",

We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.\nOur results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.\nWe further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.\nBased on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters). A single linear attention module reduces FLOPs by about 61 percent compared to softmax attention. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/techmonsterwang/LINA.",

First, reliance on dataset-specific calibration introduces significant data dependency and computational overhead. Second, being predominantly static, they fail to account for the evolving subset of knowledge neurons in LLMs during autoregressive generation as the context evolves. To address this, we introduce DART, i.e., Dynamic Attention-Guided Runtime Tracing), a lightweight, training-free method that performs on-the-fly context-based pruning. DART monitors shifts in attention score distributions to infer context changes, dynamically updating neuron-level masks to retain salient parameters. Across ten benchmarks, DART outperforms prior dynamic baseline, achieving accuracy gains of up to 14.5% on LLAMA-3.1-8B at 70% FFN sparsity. Furthermore, DART achieves up to 3x better ROUGE-L scores with respect to static-masked pruning on summarization tasks, with its performance comparable to the original dense models. We conclusively demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively adapts to diverse semantic contexts, preserves model capabilities across both general and domain-specific tasks while running at less than 10MBs of memory for LLAMA-3.1-8B(16GBs) with 0.1% FLOPs overhead.

In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure. This work provides a low-cost, scalable methodology for realistic LLM safety assessment. We will release our code and evaluation scripts upon publication to future research.",

Distinguished from previous neuro-symbolic methods limited by passive post-hoc validation, our approach actively penalizes intermediate fallacies during the reasoning chain. We operationalize this framework via a novel two-stage training pipeline that synergizes formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization.

Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.",

To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias. Furthermore, a Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment mechanism is introduced to calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time according to model evolution and instance difficulty. Experimental results in mathematical reasoning and general tasks demonstrate that UCPO effectively resolves the reward imbalance, significantly improving the reliability and calibration of the model beyond their knowledge boundaries.",

While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.",

However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect a genuine understanding of vulnerability root causes or merely an exploitation of functional patterns. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed the \"semantic trap,\" where fine-tuned LLMs achieve high detection scores by associating certain functional domains with vulnerability likelihood rather than reasoning about the underlying security http://semantics.To systematically evaluate this phenomenon, we propose TrapEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to disentangle vulnerability root cause from functional pattern. TrapEval introduces two complementary datasets derived from real-world open-source projects: V2N, which pairs vulnerable code with unrelated benign code, and V2P, which pairs vulnerable code with its corresponding patched version, forcing models to distinguish near-identical code that differs only in subtle security-critical logic. Using TrapEval, we fine-tune five representative state-of-the-art LLMs across three model families and evaluate them under cross-dataset testing, semantic-preserving perturbations, and varying degrees of semantic gap measured by http://CodeBLEU.Our empirical results reveal that, despite improvements in metrics, fine-tuned LLMs consistently struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from its patched counterpart, exhibit severe robustness degradation under minor semantic-preserving transformations, and rely heavily on functional-context shortcuts when the semantic gap is small. These findings provide strong evidence that current fine-tuning practices often fail to impart true vulnerability reasoning. Our findings serve as a wake-up call: high benchmark scores on traditional datasets may be illusory, masking the model's inability to understand the true causal logic of vulnerabilities.",

We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.",

A critical bottleneck is the lack of objective metrics for quantifying speaking style. To bridge this gap, we propose Mean Continuation Log-Probability (MCLP) as both an evaluation metric and a reward signal, validated on LALM-based Role-Play TTS (RP-TTS) tasks. Critically, we leverage the In-Context Learning capability of pre-trained LALMs to formulate MCLP via a continuation log-probability prediction. This metric quantifies stylistic consistency by measuring the likelihood of the ground-truth speech conditioned on the generated speech. Furthermore, we employ MCLP as a reinforcement learning reward to enhance the style alignment between generated speech and Role-Play instructions. To facilitate evaluation, we construct an RP-TTS dataset with rich scene and character annotations.

However, existing approaches often overlook the specialization differences among available models, treating all LLMs as uniformly applicable regardless of task characteristics.

In this work, we propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), a task-adaptive decision framework that integrates a council of LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable dynamic expert selection and efficient multi-step planning. Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence. Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and the Game of 24 demonstrate that TALC achieves superior task success rates and improved search efficiency compared to strong baselines, validating the benefits of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it is susceptible to reward overoptimization, in which policy models overfit to the reward model, exploit spurious reward patterns instead of faithfully capturing human intent. Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process. This work points to a promising new direction for improving the performance of reward models through real-time utilization of feedback from policy models.",

In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization.

We present a vignette study on the perceived cognitive and behavioral stigma toward PwD in the workplace. We designed four experimental conditions depicting a coworker with an impairment in work scenarios: overburdened work, suitable work, and robot-assisted work only for the coworker, and an offer of robot-assisted work for everyone. Our results show that cognitive stigma is significantly reduced when the work task is adapted to the person's abilities or augmented by an assistive robot. In addition, offering robot-assisted work for everyone, in the sense of universal design, further reduces perceived cognitive stigma.

Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity.

Consequently, preventing unauthorized appropriation of open-source LLMs and protecting developers' intellectual property rights have become critical challenges. In this work, we propose the Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF), a training-free, sample-efficient method for detecting whether a suspect LLM is derived from a victim model, based on the consistency between their functional network activity. We demonstrate that models that share a common origin, even with differences in scale or architecture, exhibit highly consistent patterns of neuronal activity within their functional networks across diverse input samples. In contrast, models trained independently on distinct data or with different objectives fail to preserve such activity alignment. Unlike conventional approaches, our method requires only a few samples for verification, preserves model utility, and remains robust to common model modifications (such as fine-tuning, pruning, and parameter permutation), as well as to comparisons across diverse architectures and dimensionalities. FNF thus provides model owners and third parties with a simple, non-invasive, and effective tool for protecting LLM intellectual property.

Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

These trends are consistent across various decoder-based LLMs, indicating model-agnostic effects. To address these inconsistencies, a dynamic format-alignment strategy is introduced that employs a lightweight classifier trained on latent model-preference signals. In contrast to human-designed heuristics, which often degrade performance, this approach uses model-generated signals to determine the optimal format for each problem instance. The proposed method achieves substantial and consistent improvements in zero-shot accuracy across reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, better revealing the models' latent capabilities.",

However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%.",

Drawing inspiration from congestion control in distributed systems, we view the KV cache as a shared resource whose efficient utilization depends on feedback-driven regulation. Based on this insight, we present CONCUR, a lightweight control layer that regulates agent admission to bound aggregate cache pressure while preserving execution continuity. CONCUR adapts a cache-aware control algorithm to dynamically adjust the number of active agents using runtime cache signals.\nAcross large models and real-world agent workloads, CONCUR prevents middle-phase thrashing and improves batch inference throughput by up to 4.09x on Qwen3-32B and 1.9x on DeepSeek-V3, while remaining compatible with existing LLM serving systems.",

Existing benchmarks often fall short by relying on synthetic vulnerabilities or evaluating functional correctness in isolation, failing to capture the complex interplay between functionality and security found in real-world software. To address this gap, we introduce RealSec-bench, a new benchmark for secure code generation meticulously constructed from real-world, high-risk Java repositories. Our methodology employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines systematic SAST scanning with CodeQL, LLM-based false positive elimination, and rigorous human expert validation. The resulting benchmark contains 105 instances grounded in real-word repository contexts, spanning 19 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types and exhibiting a wide diversity of data flow complexities, including vulnerabilities with up to 34-hop inter-procedural dependencies. Using RealSec-bench, we conduct an extensive empirical study on 5 popular LLMs. We introduce a novel composite metric, SecurePass@K, to assess both functional correctness and security simultaneously. We find that while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can improve functional correctness, they provide negligible benefits to security. Furthermore, explicitly prompting models with general security guidelines often leads to compilation failures, harming functional correctness without reliably preventing vulnerabilities.

Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld.",

        "abstract": "Current quantization methods for LLMs predominantly rely on block-wise structures to maintain efficiency, often at the cost of representational flexibility. In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.",

For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.",

Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the two versions of ImgCoT.",

We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks.

StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute. Our results indicate that selective escalation and deferral are effective primitives for understanding streaming social tasks. Code is publicly available on GitHub.",

This paradigm extends into deep learning through model reuse. Recently, model merging has emerged in the domain of large language models (LLMs) as a training-free approach that takes multiple task-specific models with the same architecture as source models and merges them without retraining, enhancing model reuse within LLMs. However, no prior work has systematically investigated whether such an approach can be effectively applied to other deep learning models with different architectures across domains. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study that evaluates five model merging techniques on three distinct model architectures across three domains: LLMs, image classification, and autonomous driving. Our findings reveal that directly applying existing model merging techniques leads to highly inconsistent results and falls notably short of their success within LLMs. Moreover, a single model merging technique often fails to handle the heterogeneous structural properties within a model, limiting its applicability to different model architectures across domains. Furthermore, the effectiveness of model merging techniques is highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations, thereby constraining their potential for broader adoption. Inspired by these insights, we propose AutoMerge, a novel search-based model merging framework that first segments complex models into multiple heterogeneous blocks and then systematically explores the merging space to identify the merging technique and its hyperparameter configuration.",

        "abstract": "As generative artificial intelligence advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for automated graphical user interface (GUI) design. This study investigates the usability and adaptability of LLM-generated interfaces by analysing their ability to meet diverse user needs. The experiments included utilization of three state-of-the-art models from January 2025 (OpenAI GPT o3-mini-high, DeepSeek R1, and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet) generating mockups for three interface types: a chat system, a technical team panel, and a manager dashboard. Expert evaluations revealed that while LLMs are effective at creating structured layouts, they face challenges in meeting accessibility standards and providing interactive functionality. Further testing showed that LLMs could partially tailor interfaces for different user personas but lacked deeper contextual understanding. The results suggest that while LLMs are promising tools for early-stage UI prototyping, human intervention remains critical to ensure usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.",

While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can generate correct and performant GPU kernels, kernel generation for neural processing units (NPUs) remains largely underexplored due to domain-specific programming models, limited public examples, and sparse documentation. Consequently, directly generating AscendC kernels with LLMs yields extremely low correctness, highlighting a substantial gap between GPU and NPU kernel generation.\nWe present AscendCraft, a DSL-guided approach for automatic AscendC kernel generation. AscendCraft introduces a lightweight DSL that abstracts non-essential complexity while explicitly modeling Ascend-specific execution semantics. Kernels are first generated in the DSL using category-specific expert examples and then transcompiled into AscendC through structured, constraint-driven LLM lowering passes. Evaluated on MultiKernelBench across seven operator categories, AscendCraft achieves 98.1% compilation success and 90.4% functional correctness. Moreover, 46.2% of generated kernels match or exceed PyTorch eager execution performance, demonstrating that DSL-guided transcompilation can enable LLMs to generate both correct and competitive NPU kernels. Beyond benchmarks, AscendCraft further demonstrates its generality by successfully generating two correct kernels for newly proposed mHC architecture, achieving performance that substantially surpasses PyTorch eager execution.",

We present Okara, a framework that leverages foundation models to automate the detection and deep attribution of TLS MitM Vulnerabilities (TMVs). Okara's detection component, TMV-Hunter, employs foundation model-driven GUI agents to achieve high-coverage app interaction, enabling efficient vulnerability discovery at scale. Deploying TMV-Hunter on 37,349 apps from Google Play and a third-party store revealed 8,374 (22.42%) vulnerable apps. Our measurement shows these vulnerabilities are widespread across all popularity levels, affect critical functionalities like authentication and code delivery, and are highly persistent with a median vulnerable lifespan of over 1,300 days. Okara's attribution component, TMV-ORCA, combines dynamic instrumentation with a novel LLM-based classifier to locate and categorize vulnerable code according to a comprehensive new taxonomy. This analysis attributes 41% of vulnerabilities to third-party libraries and identifies recurring insecure patterns, such as empty trust managers and flawed hostname verification. We have initiated a large-scale responsible disclosure effort and will release our tools and datasets to support further research and mitigation.",

(2) Intra-group homogenization, coarse-grained outcome rewards often lead to inefficiencies in intra-group advantage estimation with methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during sampling. To address this, we propose Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO). TSPO introduces the First-Occurrence Latent Reward (FOLR) mechanism, allocating partial rewards to the step where the ground-truth answer first appears, thereby preserving process-level signals and increasing reward variance within groups without requiring external reward models or any annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average performance gains of 24% and 13.6% on Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models, respectively.",

Recent speech large language models (Speech LLMs) have substantially improved SST quality, yet they still struggle to correctly translate rare and domain-specific terminology. While retrieval augmentation has been effective for terminology translation in machine translation, bringing retrieval to SST is non-trivial: it requires fast and accurate cross-modal (speech-to-text) retrieval under partial, continually arriving input, and the model must decide whether and when to apply retrieved terms during incremental generation. We propose Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST), which tightly integrates cross-modal retrieval into the SST pipeline. RASST trains a lightweight speech-text retriever and performs efficient sliding-window retrieval, providing chunkwise terminology hints to the Speech LLM. We further synthesize training data that teaches the Speech LLM to leverage retrieved terms precisely. Experiments on three language directions of the ACL 60/60 dev set show that RASST improves terminology translation accuracy by up to 16% and increases overall translation quality by up to 3 BLEU points, with ablations confirming the contribution of each component.",

While recent foundation models enable rich semantic representations across vision, audio, and language, retrieving relevant observations from massive archives remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-dimensional similarity search. In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization. These results demonstrate that binary, language-based retrieval enables scalable and efficient search over large wildlife archives for biodiversity monitoring systems.",

While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

Probably approximately correct (PAC) reasoning provides statistical guarantees for efficient reasoning by adaptively switching between thinking and non-thinking models, but the guarantee holds only in the marginal case and does not provide exact conditional coverage. We propose G-PAC reasoning, a practical framework that provides PAC-style guarantees at the group level by partitioning the input space. We develop two instantiations: Group PAC (G-PAC) reasoning for known group structures and Clustered PAC (C-PAC) reasoning for unknown groupings. We prove that both G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk control, and that grouping can strictly improve efficiency over marginal PAC reasoning in heterogeneous settings. Our experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that G-PAC and C-PAC successfully achieve group-conditional risk control while maintaining substantial computational savings.",

We therefore conducted an exploratory study on LLM-generated boundary explanations: in a survey, twenty-seven software professionals rated GPT-4.1 explanations for twenty boundary pairs on clarity, correctness, completeness and perceived usefulness, and six of them elaborated in follow-up interviews. Overall, 63.5% of all ratings were positive (4-5 on a five-point Likert scale) compared to 17% negative (1-2), indicating general agreement but also variability in perceptions. Participants favored explanations that followed a clear structure, cited authoritative sources, and adapted their depth to the reader's expertise; they also stressed the need for actionable examples to support debugging and documentation. From these insights, we distilled a seven-item requirement checklist that defines concrete design criteria for future LLM-based boundary explanation tools. The results suggest that, with further refinement, LLM-based tools can support testing workflows by making boundary explanations more actionable and trustworthy.",

This suggests that the computation is not uniformly distributed across the parameters. We introduce here a technique to systematically quantify computation density in LLMs. In particular, we design a density estimator drawing on mechanistic interpretability. We experimentally test our estimator and find that: (1) contrary to what has been often assumed, LLM processing generally involves dense computation; (2) computation density is dynamic, in the sense that models shift between sparse and dense processing regimes depending on the input; (3) per-input density is significantly correlated across LLMs, suggesting that the same inputs trigger either low or high density. Investigating the factors influencing density, we observe that predicting rarer tokens requires higher density, and increasing context length often decreases the density. We believe that our computation density estimator will contribute to a better understanding of the processing at work in LLMs, challenging their symbolic interpretation.",

To analyze their individual impact and to test new material configurations, a high-resolution simulation at the city scale is required.

We propose HeatMat, an approach to analyze at high resolution the individual impact of urban materials on the UHI effect in a real city, relying only on open data. We estimate building materials using street-view images and a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to supplement existing OpenStreetMap data, which describes the 2D geometry and features of buildings. We further encode this information into a set of 2D maps that represent the city's vertical structure and material characteristics. These maps serve as inputs for our 2.5D simulator, which models coupled heat transfers and enables random-access surface temperature estimation at multiple resolutions, reaching an x20 speedup compared to an equivalent simulation in 3D.",

We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance.

        "abstract": "The NVFP4 lower-precision format, supported in hardware by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, promises to allow, for the first time, end-to-end fully-quantized pre-training of massive models such as LLMs. Yet, existing quantized training methods still sacrifice some of the representation capacity of this format in favor of more accurate unbiased quantized gradient estimation by stochastic rounding (SR), losing noticeable accuracy relative to standard FP16 and FP8 training. In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16.

We formalize payload recoverability via classifier accuracy and show previous schemes achieve 100\\% recoverability. In response, we introduce low-recoverability steganography, replacing arbitrary mappings with embedding-space-derived ones. For Llama-8B (LoRA) and Ministral-8B (LoRA) trained on TrojanStego prompts, exact secret recovery rises from 17$\\rightarrow$30\\% (+78\\%) and 24$\\rightarrow$43\\% (+80\\%) respectively, while on Llama-70B (LoRA) trained on Wiki prompts, it climbs from 9$\\rightarrow$19\\% (+123\\%), all while reducing payload recoverability. We then discuss detection. We argue that detecting fine-tuning-based steganographic attacks requires approaches beyond traditional steganalysis. Standard approaches measure distributional shift, which is an expected side-effect of fine-tuning. Instead, we propose a mechanistic interpretability approach: linear probes trained on later-layer activations detect the secret with up to 33\\% higher accuracy in fine-tuned models compared to base models, even for low-recoverability schemes. This suggests that malicious fine-tuning leaves actionable internal signatures amenable to interpretability-based defenses.",

In this setting, aligning style with high task performance is particularly challenging due to distribution shift and inherent conflicts between style and reward. Existing methods, despite introducing numerous definitions of style, often fail to reconcile these objectives effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a unified definition of behavior style and instantiate it into a practical framework. Building on this, we introduce Style-Conditioned Implicit Q-Learning (SCIQL), which leverages offline goal-conditioned RL techniques, such as hindsight relabeling and value learning, and combine it with a new Gated Advantage Weighted Regression mechanism to efficiently optimize task performance while preserving style alignment. Experiments demonstrate that SCIQL achieves superior performance on both objectives compared to prior offline methods.

For a generic stable discretization of $X$ in terms of a dense sequence $(V_m)_{m \\in \\mathbb{N}_0}$ of finite-dimensional subspaces, we obtain fully-discrete, linear approximations in terms of so-called sparse-grid tensor-product projectors, with convergence rates of approximations as well as of sparse-grid tensor-product quadratures of the target functions.\nWe verify the abstract assumptions in two fundamental application settings: first, a linear elliptic diffusion equation with affine-parametric coefficients and second, abstract holomorphic maps between separable Hilbert spaces with affine-parametric input data encoding. For these settings, as in [37,20], cancellation of anti-symmetric terms in ultra-spherical Jacobi generalized polynomial chaos expansion coefficients implies crucially improved convergence rates of sparse-grid tensor-product quadrature with respect to the infinite-tensor-product Jacobi weight, free from the ``curse-of-dimension\".\nLargely self-contained proofs of all results are developed.

Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators. The merged LoRAs retain less weights and incur no inference latency, making our method computationally lightweight.",

Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of semantic reasoning versus geometric regression, supporting the use of LVLMs as high-level safety validators in SOTIF-oriented automated driving systems.",

Analyzing 22,126 generated tests, we show code-change-aware methods improve candidate catch generation 4x over hardening tests and 20x over coincidentally failing tests. To address false positives, we use rule-based and LLM-based assessors. These assessors reduce human review load by 70%. Inferential statistical analysis showed that human-accepted code changes are assessed to have significantly more false positives, while human-rejected changes have significantly more true positives. We reported 41 candidate catches to engineers; 8 were confirmed to be true positives, 4 of which would have led to serious failures had they remained uncaught. Overall, our results show that Just-in-Time catching is scalable, industrially applicable, and that it prevents serious failures from reaching production.",

This mismatch forces the generative model to learn from unordered distributions, leading to bias and weak coherence. To address this, we propose native visual tokenization, which enforces causal dependencies during tokenization. Building on this idea, we introduce NativeTok, a framework that achieves efficient reconstruction while embedding relational constraints within token sequences. NativeTok consists of: (1) a Meta Image Transformer (MIT) for latent image modeling, and (2) a Mixture of Causal Expert Transformer (MoCET), where each lightweight expert block generates a single token conditioned on prior tokens and latent features. We further design a Hierarchical Native Training strategy that updates only new expert blocks, ensuring training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NativeTok.",

To address this task, we introduce a Neural Clothing Tryer (NCT) framework, which exploits the advanced diffusion models equipped with semantic enhancement and controlling modules to better preserve semantic characterization and textural details of the garment and meanwhile facilitating the flexible editing of the model's postures and appearances. Specifically, NCT introduces a semantic-enhanced module to take semantic descriptions of garments and utilizes a visual-language encoder to learn aligned features across modalities. The aligned features are served as condition input to the diffusion model to enhance the preservation of the garment's semantics. Then, a semantic controlling module is designed to take the garment image, tailored posture image, and semantic description as input to maintain garment details while simultaneously editing model postures, expressions, and various attributes. Extensive experiments on the open available benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed NCT framework.",

We show that these equivariance-regularised latent spaces improve generation quality while preserving the computational advantages of latent flow models.

This paper proposes a sample-efficient robust optimal control approach for the determination of assembly motions, which requires significantly less physics simulation steps during planning through the efficient use of derivative information. To this end, a differentiable physics simulation is constructed that provides second-order analytic derivatives to the numerical solver and allows one to traverse seamlessly from informative derivatives to accurate contact simulation. The solution of the physics simulation problem is made differentiable by using smoothing inspired by interior-point methods applied to both the collision detection as well as the contact resolution problem. We propose a modified variant of an optimization-based formulation of collision detection formulated as a linear program and present an efficient implementation for the nominal evaluation and corresponding first- and second-order derivatives. Moreover, a multi-scenario-based trajectory optimization problem that ensures robustness with respect to sim-to-real mismatches is derived. The capability of the considered formulation is illustrated by results where over 99\\% successful executions are achieved in real-world experiments. Thereby, we carefully investigate the effect of smooth approximations of the contact dynamics and robust modeling on the success rates. Furthermore, the method's capability is tested on different peg-in-hole problems in simulation to show the benefit of using exact Hessians over commonly used Hessian approximations.",

Recent studies have found that LLMs process multilingual inputs in shared concept spaces, thought to support generalization and cross-lingual transfer. However, these prior studies often do not use causal methods, lack deeper error analysis or focus on the final model only, leaving open how these spaces emerge during training. We investigate the development of language-agnostic concept spaces during pretraining of EuroLLM through the causal interpretability method of activation patching. We isolate cross-lingual concept representations, then inject them into a translation prompt to investigate how consistently translations can be altered, independently of the language. We find that shared concept spaces emerge early} and continue to refine, but that alignment with them is language-dependent}. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our fine-grained manual analysis reveals that some apparent gains in translation quality reflect shifts in behavior -- like selecting senses for polysemous words or translating instead of copying cross-lingual homographs -- rather than improved translation ability. Our findings offer new insight into the training dynamics of cross-lingual alignment and the conditions under which causal interpretability methods offer meaningful insights in multilingual contexts.",

Existing solutions rely on specialized sensors: either heavy, costly airborne LiDAR, or Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), which uses thermal synthetic aperture photography and is tailored for person detection.\nWe introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB images. Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.\nTo validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images). Additionally, we show the potential of our approach for forest inventory tasks like tree counting. These results position our approach as a cost-effective, high-resolution alternative to specialized sensors for SAR, trail mapping, and forest-inventory tasks.",

        "abstract": "Battery energy storage systems are increasingly deployed as fast-responding resources for grid balancing services such as frequency regulation and for mitigating renewable generation uncertainty. However, repeated charging and discharging induces cycling degradation and reduces battery lifetime. This paper studies the real-time scheduling of a heterogeneous battery fleet that collectively tracks a stochastic balancing signal subject to per-battery ramp-rate and capacity constraints, while minimizing long-term cycling degradation.\nCycling degradation is fundamentally path-dependent: it is determined by charge-discharge cycles formed by the state-of-charge (SoC) trajectory and is commonly quantified via rainflow cycle counting. This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction.\nTo scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on a toy Markovian signal model and on a Markovian model trained from real-world regulation signal traces obtained from the University of Delaware, and demonstrate consistent reductions in cycle-depth occurrence and degradation metrics compared to baseline scheduling policies.",

However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs. On the GLUE benchmark, Matterhorn establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing existing SNNs by 1.42% in average accuracy while delivering a 2.31 times improvement in energy efficiency.",

The cooling system consists of a fixed-capacity electric chiller and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, jointly operated to meet stochastic hourly cooling demands under time-varying electricity prices. The life-cycle cost accounts for both capital expenditure and discounted operating cost, including electricity consumption and maintenance. A key challenge arises from the strong asymmetry in capital costs: increasing chiller capacity by one unit is far more expensive than an equivalent increase in TES capacity. As a result, identifying the right combination of chiller and TES sizes, while ensuring zero loss-of-cooling-load under optimal operation, is a non-trivial co-design problem. To address this, we formulate the chiller operation problem for a fixed infrastructure configuration as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the control action is the chiller part-load ratio (PLR). The MDP is solved using a Deep Q Network (DQN) with a constrained action space. The learned DQN RL policy minimizes electricity cost over historical traces of cooling demand and electricity prices. For each candidate chiller-TES sizing configuration, the trained policy is evaluated. We then restrict attention to configurations that fully satisfy the cooling demand and perform a life-cycle cost minimization over this feasible set to identify the cost-optimal infrastructure design. Using this approach, we determine the optimal chiller and thermal energy storage capacities to be 700 and 1500, respectively.",

Despite TÃ¼rkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages.",

Partnering with native linguists, we design an annotated and scalable rule-based LLM transformation to ensure precision. Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models.

Even frontier models achieve under 70% accuracy, fail to reach 50% for Canadian English, and systematically misclassify non-SAE dialects as American or British.

Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM.

In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Hawkeye outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes better across multiple datasets. The code and models will be made available.",

Our findings reveal a distinct trade-off between the two approaches. Prompted proprietary models demonstrate the highest sensitivity to SBRs, achieving a G-measure of 77% and a recall of 74% on average across all the datasets, albeit at the cost of a higher false-positive rate, resulting in an average precision of only 22%. Fine-tuned models, by contrast, exhibit the opposite behavior, attaining a lower overall G-measure of 51% but substantially higher precision of 75% at the cost of reduced recall of 36%. Though a one-time investment in building fine-tuned models is necessary, the inference on the largest dataset is up to 50 times faster than that of proprietary models. These findings suggest that further investigations to harness the power of LLMs for SBR prediction are necessary.",

However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.\nBoth attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted. These limitations are particularly relevant in pervasive and distributed computing settings where LLMs are deployed as system components and interpretability methods are relied upon for debugging, compression, and explaining models.",

We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1",

To overcome this limitation, we present MTDrive, a multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to iteratively refine trajectories based on environmental feedback. MTDrive introduces Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (mtGRPO), which mitigates reward sparsity by computing relative advantages across turns. We further construct an interactive trajectory understanding dataset from closed-loop simulation to support multi-turn training. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our multi-turn reasoning paradigm. Additionally, we implement system-level optimizations to reduce data transfer overhead caused by high-resolution images and multi-turn sequences, achieving 2.5x training throughput.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce CSM-MTBench, a benchmark covering five Chinese-foreign language directions and consisting of two expert-curated subsets: Fun Posts, featuring context-rich, slang- and neologism-heavy content, and Social Snippets, emphasizing concise, emotion- and style- driven expressions. Furthermore, we propose tailored evaluation approaches for each subset: measuring the translation success rate of slang and neologisms in Fun Posts, while assessing tone and style preservation in Social Snippets via a hybrid of embedding-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge. Experiments on over 20 models reveal substantial variation in how current MT systems handle semantic fidelity and informal, social-media-specific stylistic cues. CSM-MTBench thus serves as a rigorous testbed for advancing MT systems capable of mastering real-world Chinese social media texts.",

This paper investigates the use of Differential Privacy (DP) as a robust defense mechanism for training an LLM for Kotlin code completion. We fine-tune a \\texttt{Mellum} model using DP and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its privacy and utility. Our results demonstrate that DP provides a strong defense against Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), reducing the attack's success rate close to a random guess (AUC from 0.901 to 0.606). Furthermore, we show that this privacy guarantee comes at a minimal cost to model performance, with the DP-trained model achieving utility scores comparable to its non-private counterpart, even when trained on 100x less data. Our findings suggest that DP is a practical and effective solution for building private and trustworthy AI-powered IDE features.",

We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token <slack> via the connectionist temporal classification objective. We apply this approach to the widely used MDLM model and conduct experiments on five open-ended text generation benchmarks. Our method consistently outperforms the original model and improves robustness to positional shifts, indicating that relaxing strict positional supervision is an important factor in improving generation quality in MDLMs.",

Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.",

Prior studies have pointed out several limitations of perplexity, often from an empirical manner. Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.",

Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a promising direction by enabling iterative reasoning, tool use, and environment interaction to refine SAST alerts. However, the comparative effectiveness of different LLM-based agent architectures for FP filtering remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a comparative study of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agent frameworks, i.e., Aider, OpenHands, and SWE-agent, for vulnerability FP filtering. We evaluate these frameworks using the vulnerabilities from the OWASP Benchmark and real-world open-source Java projects. The experimental results show that LLM-based agents can remove the majority of SAST noise, reducing an initial FP detection rate of over 92% on the OWASP Benchmark to as low as 6.3% in the best configuration. On real-world dataset, the best configuration of LLM-based agents can achieve an FP identification rate of up to 93.3% involving CodeQL alerts. However, the benefits of agents are strongly backbone- and CWE-dependent: agentic frameworks significantly outperform vanilla prompting for stronger models such as Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5, but yield limited or inconsistent gains for weaker backbones. Moreover, aggressive FP reduction can come at the cost of suppressing true vulnerabilities, highlighting important trade-offs. Finally, we observe large disparities in computational cost across agent frameworks. Overall, our study demonstrates that LLM-based agents are a powerful but non-uniform solution for SAST FP filtering, and that their practical deployment requires careful consideration of agent design, backbone model choice, vulnerability category, and operational cost.",

However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a \"remasking\" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels.",

A good selection could make issue resolution more reliable while reducing regression and operational risk, whereas a poor choice can increase risk and even cause unpredictable failures.\nWe first conduct a manual study of real-world issues to characterize the rationales maintainers use when selecting among competing proposals. Motivated by these findings, we introduce SWE-Manager, a joint selection and synthesis approach that selects the best proposal and synthesizes a golden proposal. SWE-Manager is an 8B model trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to compare proposals, justify its choice, and synthesize a golden proposal for implementation. We view proposal selection as a reasoning task, mirroring how technical managers review competing proposals by weighing issue context and each proposal's solution without executing code or running tests. On the SWE-Lancer Manager benchmark, SWE-Manager achieves 53.21 selection accuracy and 57.75 earn rate, earning 152,750 dollars and outperforming strong baselines including GPT-5.

These approaches require representative datasets for effective model training. However, while non-defective components are frequent, defective parts are rare in production, resulting in highly imbalanced datasets that adversely impact model performance. Existing strategies to address this challenge, such as specialized loss functions or traditional data augmentation techniques, have limitations, including the need for careful hyperparameter tuning or the alteration of only simple image features. Therefore, this work explores the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) as an alternative method for expanding limited datasets and enhancing supervised machine learning performance. Specifically, we investigate Stable Diffusion and CycleGAN as image generation models, focusing on the segmentation of combine harvester components in thermal images for subsequent defect detection. Our results demonstrate that dataset expansion using Stable Diffusion yields the most significant improvement, enhancing segmentation performance by 4.6 %, resulting in a Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU) of 84.6 %.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion policies (DP) have demonstrated significant potential in visual navigation by capturing diverse multi-modal trajectory distributions. However, standard imitation learning (IL), which most DP methods rely on for training, often inherits sub-optimality and redundancy from expert demonstrations, thereby necessitating a computationally intensive \"generate-then-filter\" pipeline that relies on auxiliary selectors during inference. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy (SIDP), a novel framework that learns improved planning by selectively imitating a set of trajectories sampled from itself. Specifically, SIDP introduces a reward-guided self-imitation mechanism that encourages the policy to consistently produce high-quality trajectories efficiently, rather than outputs of inconsistent quality, thereby reducing reliance on extensive sampling and post-filtering. During training, we employ a reward-driven curriculum learning paradigm to mitigate inefficient data utility, and goal-agnostic exploration for trajectory augmentation to improve planning robustness. Extensive evaluations on a comprehensive simulation benchmark show that SIDP significantly outperforms previous methods, with real-world experiments confirming its effectiveness across multiple robotic platforms. On Jetson Orin Nano, SIDP delivers a 2.5$\\times$ faster inference than the baseline NavDP, i.e., 110ms VS 273ms, enabling efficient real-time deployment.",

We hypothesize that these outliers, in conjunction with the corresponding normalizations (\\textit{e.g.}, softmax attention and RMSNorm), effectively rescale other non-outlier components. We term this phenomenon \\textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).",

The allocation module enables the manager to allocate tasks from a global perspective, thereby avoiding potential inter-agent conflicts. The summary module, triggered by task progress updates, performs episodic memory integration by condensing recent collaboration history into a concise summary that preserves long-horizon context.

Yet, scaling up RL is bottlenecked by limited existing verifiable data, where improvements increasingly saturate over prolonged training. To overcome this, we propose Golden Goose, a simple trick to synthesize unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text by constructing a multiple-choice question-answering version of the fill-in-the-middle task. Given a source text, we prompt an LLM to identify and mask key reasoning steps, then generate a set of diverse, plausible distractors. This enables us to leverage reasoning-rich unverifiable corpora typically excluded from prior RLVR data construction (e.g., science textbooks) to synthesize GooseReason-0.7M, a large-scale RLVR dataset with over 0.7 million tasks spanning mathematics, programming, and general scientific domains. Empirically, GooseReason effectively revives models saturated on existing RLVR data, yielding robust, sustained gains under continuous RL and achieving new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B-Instruct models across 15 diverse benchmarks. Finally, we deploy Golden Goose in a real-world setting, synthesizing RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes for the cybersecurity domain, where no prior RLVR data exists. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on the resulting data GooseReason-Cyber sets a new state-of-the-art in cybersecurity, surpassing a 7B domain-specialized model with extensive domain-specific pre-training and post-training.

Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($d\\sigma^2\\gamma^{-2}\\log(Nd/\\delta)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters. These results move trustworthy AI beyond explaining single models: they establish a principled, intervention-based science of auditing and governing heterogeneous model ecosystems.",

A promising direction to further improve post-pruning performance is weight permutation, which reorders model weights into patterns more amenable to pruning. However, the exponential growth of the permutation search space with the scale of Transformer architectures forces most methods to rely on greedy or heuristic algorithms, limiting the effectiveness of reordering.\nIn this work, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework. Our method introduces a learnable permutation cost matrix to quantify the cost of swapping any two input channels of a given weight matrix, a differentiable bipartite matching solver to obtain the optimal binary permutation matrix given a cost matrix, and a sparsity optimization loss function to directly optimize the permutation operator. We extensively validate our approach on vision and language Transformers, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art permutation results for structured sparsity.",

        "abstract": "Factory automation has become increasingly important due to labor shortages, leading to the introduction of autonomous mobile robots for tasks such as material transportation. Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality. Future work will investigate the relationship between confidence thresholds and recognition performance.",

The method is plug-and-play with common decoding strategies (e.g., confidence, entropy, and margin-based ordering) and can be strengthened with a one-step lookahead variant.

To address these challenges, we present MethodName, a unified representation-policy learning framework for view-generalizable robotic manipulation. MethodName introduces a single-view 3D pretraining paradigm that leverages point cloud reconstruction and feed-forward gaussian splatting under multi-view supervision to learn holistic geometric representations. During policy learning, MethodName performs multi-step distillation to preserve the pretrained geometric understanding and effectively transfer it to manipulation skills. We conduct experiments on 12 RLBench tasks, where our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 12.7% in average success rate. Further evaluation on six representative tasks demonstrates strong zero-shot view generalization, with success rate drops of only 22.0% and 29.7% under moderate and large viewpoint shifts respectively, whereas the state-of-the-art method suffers larger decreases of 41.6% and 51.5%.",

This growth couples scheduling decisions with feasibility: a scheduler must minimize latency under a hard memory budget, yet the response lengths of requests are inherently unknown. While recent works have explored this problem either assuming clairvoyance -- exact knowledge of response lengths -- or relying on machine-learned predictions, obtaining robust performance guarantees without any prior knowledge of job sizes remains a theoretically fundamental and practically important open problem.\nIn this work, we propose the Geometric Slicing Algorithm (GSA), the non-clairvoyant policy to achieve the first constant competitive ratio for this problem in the offline batch setting. GSA manages uncertainty through a geometric phase structure that periodically restarts jobs to bound memory exposure, combined with a staggered pipeline mechanism that enables high concurrency by smoothing aggregate memory consumption. We prove that GSA achieves a competitive ratio of at most 61.92 for general instances, improving to 32 in the large-memory regime. Our algorithmic framework also yields a clairvoyant counterpart, the Geometric Batching Algorithm (GBA), which achieves an approximation ratio of 10.67 for general instances and 6.75 in the large-memory regime -- significantly improving upon the best previously known bound of over 9000.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, they often struggle with the rigorous requirements of smart contracts, frequently producing code that is buggy or vulnerable. To address this, we propose SolAgent, a novel tool-augmented multi-agent framework that mimics the workflow of human experts. SolAgent integrates a \\textbf{dual-loop refinement mechanism}: an inner loop using the \\textit{Forge} compiler to ensure functional correctness, and an outer loop leveraging the \\textit{Slither} static analyzer to eliminate security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the agent is equipped with file system capabilities to resolve complex project dependencies. Experiments on the SolEval+ Benchmark, a rigorous suite derived from high-quality real-world projects, demonstrate that SolAgent achieves a Pass@1 rate of up to \\textbf{64.39\\%}, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs ($\\sim$25\\%), AI IDEs (e.g., GitHub Copilot), and existing agent frameworks. Moreover, it reduces security vulnerabilities by up to \\textbf{39.77\\%} compared to human-written baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that the high-quality trajectories generated by SolAgent can be used to distill smaller, open-source models, democratizing access to secure smart contract generation.

However, most existing methods commit to a single constraint family: weighted behavior cloning, density regularization, or support constraints, without a unified principle that explains their connections or trade-offs. In this work, we propose Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI), a unified optimization framework in which these three constraint families arise as special cases along a common constraint spectrum. The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types. Building on CCI, we develop Automatic Constraint Policy Optimization (ACPO), a practical primal--dual algorithm that adapts the interpolation parameter via a Lagrangian dual update. Moreover, we establish a maximum-entropy performance difference lemma and derive performance lower bounds for both the closed-form optimal policy and its parametric projection. Experiments on D4RL and NeoRL2 demonstrate robust gains across diverse domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance overall.",

To address this limitation, we introduce Mem-T, an autonomous memory agent that interfaces with a lightweight hierarchical memory database to perform dynamic updates and multi-turn retrieval over streaming inputs. To effectively train long-horizon memory management capabilities, we further propose MoT-GRPO, a tree-guided reinforcement learning framework that transforms sparse terminal feedback into dense, step-wise supervision via memory operation tree backpropagation and hindsight credit assignment, thereby enabling the joint optimization of memory construction and retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mem-T is (1) high-performing, surpassing frameworks such as A-Mem and Mem0 by up to $14.92\\%$, and (2) economical, operating on a favorable accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier and reducing inference tokens per query by $\\sim24.45\\%$ relative to GAM without sacrificing performance.",

However, existing ABSA research relies on coarse-grained categorical labels (e.g., positive, negative), which limits its ability to capture nuanced affective states. To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores. This resource contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences, spanning six languages and four domains. We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA. Given that these subtasks involve both categorical and continuous outputs, we propose a new unified metric, continuous F1 (cF1), which incorporates VA prediction error into standard F1. We provide a comprehensive benchmark using both prompted and fine-tuned large language models across all subtasks. Our results show that DimABSA is a challenging benchmark and provides a foundation for advancing multilingual dimensional ABSA.",

However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.

Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR.",

The framework dynamically allocates exploration and measurement tasks based on each robot's capabilities, leveraging team-level redundancy and specialization to enable continuous operation. We validated the framework in a space-analog field experiment emulating a lunar prospecting scenario, involving a heterogeneous team of five robots and a single operator. Despite the complete failure of one robot during the mission, the team completed 82.3% of assigned tasks at an Autonomy Ratio of 86%, while the operator workload remained at only 78.2%. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, scalable multi-robot scientific exploration with limited operator intervention. We further derive practical lessons learned in robot interoperability, networking architecture, team composition, and operator workload management to inform future multi-robot exploration missions.",

We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving. Finally, we find that fine-tuning with scenario data improves performance, whereas formulation-only training is ineffective. However, performance gaps are only partially alleviated, highlighting contextual mathematical reasoning as a central unsolved challenge for LLMs.",

While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them.

Using an automated judge (with targeted human audit) and comparing the current backend to legacy variants (GPT-4.1/4o), we find that notifications are selective rather than comprehensive: privacy violence, fraud, hate speech, and malware triggered no parental alerts in our runs, whereas physical harm (highest), pornography, and some health queries produced intermittent alerts. The current backend shows lower leak-through than legacy models, yet overblocking of benign, educational queries near sensitive topics remains common and is not surfaced to parents, revealing a policy-product gap between on-screen safeguards and parent-facing telemetry.

These platforms incorporate mechanisms to assess the quality of answers and participants' expertise, ideally free from discriminatory biases. However, prior research has highlighted persistent gender biases, raising concerns about the inclusivity and fairness of these systems. Addressing such biases is crucial for fostering equitable online communities. While previous studies focus on detecting gender bias by comparing male and female user characteristics, they often overlook the interaction between genders, inherent answer quality, and the selection of ``best answers'' by question askers. In this study, we investigate whether answer quality is influenced by gender using a combination of human evaluations and automated assessments powered by Large Language Models. Our findings reveal no significant gender differences in answer quality, nor any substantial influence of gender bias on the selection of ``best answers.\" Instead, we find that the significant gender disparities in SO's reputation scores are primarily attributable to differences in users' activity levels, e.g., the number of questions and answers they write. Our results have important implications for the design of scoring systems in community question-answering platforms. In particular, reputation systems that heavily emphasize activity volume risk amplifying gender disparities that do not reflect actual differences in answer quality, calling for more equitable design strategies.",

        "abstract": "Recent reconstruction methods based on radiance field such as NeRF and 3DGS reproduce indoor scenes with high visual fidelity, but break down under scene editing due to baked illumination and the lack of explicit light transport. In contrast, physically based inverse rendering relies on mesh representations and path tracing, which enforce correct light transport but place strong requirements on geometric fidelity, becoming a practical bottleneck for real indoor scenes. In this work, we propose Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing (EAG-PT), aiming for physically based light transport with a unified 2D Gaussian representation. Our design is based on three cores: (1) using 2D Gaussians as a unified scene representation and transport-friendly geometry proxy that avoids reconstructed mesh, (2) explicitly separating emissive and non-emissive components during reconstruction for further scene editing, and (3) decoupling reconstruction from final rendering by using efficient single-bounce optimization and high-quality multi-bounce path tracing after scene editing. Experiments on synthetic and real indoor scenes show that EAG-PT produces more natural and physically consistent renders after editing than radiant scene reconstructions, while preserving finer geometric detail and avoiding mesh-induced artifacts compared to mesh-based inverse path tracing. These results suggest promising directions for future use in interior design, XR content creation, and embodied AI.",

Existing audio large language model (LLM)-based methods excel in content understanding; however, their predictions are often biased toward semantically correlated cues, which results in fine-grained acoustic artifacts being overlooked during the decisionmaking process. Consequently, fake speech with natural semantics can bypass detectors despite harboring subtle acoustic anomalies; this suggests that the challenge stems not from the absence of acoustic data, but from its inadequate accessibility when semantic-dominant reasoning prevails. To address this issue, we investigate SDD within the audio LLM paradigm and introduce SDD with Auditory Perception-enhanced Audio Large Language Model (SDD-APALLM), an acoustically enhanced framework designed to explicitly expose fine-grained time-frequency evidence as accessible acoustic cues. By combining raw audio with structured spectrograms, the proposed framework empowers audio LLMs to more effectively capture subtle acoustic inconsistencies without compromising their semantic understanding. Experimental results indicate consistent gains in detection accuracy and robustness, especially in cases where semantic cues are misleading. Further analysis reveals that these improvements stem from a coordinated utilization of semantic and acoustic information, as opposed to simple modality aggregation.",

However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since naÃ¯ve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

We study discretized categorical actors that represent each action dimension with a distribution over bins, yielding a policy objective that resembles a cross-entropy loss.

Current retrieval systems either ignore these constraints in neural embeddings or approximate them in a generative reasoning process that can be inconsistent and unreliable. Although well-suited to structured reasoning, existing neuro-symbolic approaches remain confined to formal logic or mathematics problems as they often assume unambiguous queries and access to complete evidence, conditions rarely met in information retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework that decouples predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning: a large language model (LLM) provides plausibility scores for atomic predicates in one decoding-free forward pass, from which a probabilistic reasoning engine derives the posterior probability of query satisfaction. We evaluate OrLog across multiple backbone LLMs, varying levels of access to external knowledge, and a range of logical constraints, and compare it against base retrievers and LLM-as-reasoner methods. Provided with entity descriptions, OrLog can significantly boost top-rank precision compared to LLM reasoning with larger gains on disjunctive queries. OrLog is also more efficient, cutting mean tokens by $\\sim$90\\% per query-entity pair. These results demonstrate that generation-free predicate plausibility estimation combined with probabilistic reasoning enables constraint-aware retrieval that outperforms monolithic reasoning while using far fewer tokens.",

CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT. Our findings suggest that current practices of penalising harmful generations may inadvertently lead to a reduction in the broader monitorability of LLMs in unpredictable ways.",

By encoding action sequences into temporally regularized latent trajectories and learning an explicit latent-space flow, the proposed approach decouples global motion structure from low-level control noise, resulting in smooth and reliable long-horizon execution.\nLG-Flow Policy further incorporates geometry-aware point cloud conditioning and execution-time multimodal modulation, with visual cues evaluated as a representative modality in real-world settings. Experimental results in simulation and on physical robot platforms demonstrate that LG-Flow Policy achieves near single-step inference, substantially improves trajectory smoothness and task success over flow-based baselines operating in the raw action space, and remains significantly more efficient than diffusion-based policies.",

By utilizing semantic embedding vectors as cache keys, this mechanism effectively minimizes latency and redundant computation for semantically similar queries.

We demonstrate that the locality required to maximize cache hit rates fundamentally conflicts with the cryptographic avalanche effect necessary for collision resistance. Our conceptual analysis formalizes this inherent trade-off between performance (locality) and security (collision resilience), revealing that semantic caching is naturally vulnerable to key collision attacks.\nWhile prior research has focused on side-channel and privacy risks, we present the first systematic study of integrity risks arising from cache collisions. We introduce CacheAttack, an automated framework for launching black-box collision attacks. We evaluate CacheAttack in security-critical tasks and agentic workflows. It achieves a hit rate of 86\\% in LLM response hijacking and can induce malicious behaviors in LLM agent, while preserving strong transferability across different embedding models.

In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a dynamic safety protocol for improving an LLM's inference-time defenses against deceptive attacks that make use of maliciously perturbed policy texts. Through various levels of one-sentence textual cues, DEF nudges LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and fallback to their parametric knowledge upon encountering perturbed policy texts. Using globally recognized legal policies such as HIPAA and GDPR, our empirical evaluations report that DEF effectively improves the capability of frontier LLMs to detect and refuse perturbed versions of policies, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one setting.

We introduce a Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective (CATTO), a calibration-aware objective that aligns predicted confidence with empirical prediction correctness, which can be combined with the original preference optimization objectives. Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline.

In this paper, we present a framework exploiting a comprehensive multimodal strategy for automated trailer production. Also, a Large Language Model (LLM) is adopted across various stages of the trailer creation. First, it selects main key visual sequences that are relevant to the movie's core narrative. Then, it extracts the most appealing quotes from the movie, aligning them with the trailer's narrative. Additionally, the LLM assists in creating music backgrounds and voiceovers to enrich the audience's engagement, thus contributing to make a trailer not just a summary of the movie's content but a narrative experience in itself.

We prove bounded correction and $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ termination. Experiments on mathematical reasoning (CAP-GSM8K) and causal judgment (CausalL2) reveal four mechanisms explaining model unreliability: (1) Latent Competence Suppression, where models derive correct answers then overwrite them under social pressure; (2) The False Competence Trap, where weaker judges mask sycophancy that stronger judges expose; (3) The Complexity-Vulnerability Tradeoff, where causal tasks induce more than 10 times higher sycophancy than mathematical tasks; and (4) Iatrogenic Critique, where authoritative correction harms weaker models.

Among RL algorithms, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is the de facto standard, avoiding the need for a critic by using per-prompt baselines and variance normalization. Yet why and when this normalization helps remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation through the lens of local curvature of the sequence-level policy gradient: standard deviation normalization implements an adaptive gradient. Theoretically, under mild conditions, GRPO enjoys a strictly improved convergence rate over unnormalized REINFORCE, with gains characterized by the average within-prompt reward standard deviation across prompts and iterations. Empirically, our analysis on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks reveals three distinct training phases governed by the interplay between feature orthogonality and reward variance: (I) an early acceleration phase where high variance and orthogonality favor adaptive scaling; (II) a relatively stable transition phase; and (III) a late-stage regime where the loss of orthogonality limits further gains. Together, these results provide a principled account of when std normalization helps in GRPO, and offer broader insights into the design of critic-free RL algorithms.",

However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost.

While sycophancy has been extensively studied in text and vision-language models, its manifestation in audio-conditioned reasoning remains largely unexplored, despite the need for ALMs to rely on auditory cues such as acoustic events, speaker characteristics, and speech rate. To address this gap, we introduce SYAUDIO, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating sycophancy in ALMs, consisting of 4,319 audio questions spanning Audio Perception, Audio Reasoning, Audio Math, and Audio Ethics. Built upon established audio benchmarks and augmented with TTS-generated arithmetic and moral reasoning tasks, SYAUDIO enables systematic evaluation across multiple domains and sycophancy types with carefully verified data quality. Furthermore, we analyze audio-specific sycophancy under realistic conditions involving noise and rate, and demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning with chain-of-thought data is an effective mitigation strategy for reducing sycophantic behavior in ALMs.",

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.",

The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks.",

Experiments on MMSU, MMAU, and MMAR show that DIFFA-2 consistently improves over DIFFA and is competitive to strong AR LALMs under practical training budgets, supporting diffusion-based modeling is a viable backbone for large-scale audio understanding.

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.",

We introduce a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization that leverages complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, without access to ground-truth proofs or existing formalizations at inference time. Our approach optimizes a masked composite objective over Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality, guided by a responsiveness map that indicates how different LLMs acting as different roles preferentially improve each dimension. We further propose an acceptance policy that guarantees certified monotonic improvement, and provide conditions ensuring convergence and termination.

In this study, we propose Rendered CoT-Guided variational Latent Reasoning (ReGuLaR), a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm resolving this issue. Fundamentally, we formulate latent reasoning within the Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) framework, sampling the current latent reasoning state from the posterior distribution conditioned on previous ones.

In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of encoder based classifiers (BERT, SciBERT, and PatentSBERTa) and open weight LLMs on a highly imbalanced benchmark dataset (USPTO 70k). We evaluate LLMs under zero shot, few shot, and retrieval augmented prompting, and further assess parameter efficient fine tuning of the best performing model. Our results show that encoder based models achieve higher aggregate performance, driven by strong results on frequent CPC subclasses, but struggle on rare ones. In contrast, LLMs achieve relatively higher performance on infrequent subclasses, often associated with early stage, cross domain, or weakly institutionalised technologies, particularly at higher hierarchical levels. These findings indicate that encoder based and LLM based approaches play complementary roles in patent classification. We additionally quantify inference time and energy consumption, showing that encoder based models are up to three orders of magnitude more efficient than LLMs. Overall, our results inform responsible patentometrics and technology mapping, and motivate hybrid classification approaches that combine encoder efficiency with the long tail coverage of LLMs under computational and environmental constraints.",

Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation. While local quality assessment remains an open question, our results demonstrate feasibility for real-time generation under typical game engine constraints.",

        "abstract": "Consider a multi-agent systems setup in which a principal (a supervisor agent) assigns subtasks to specialized agents and aggregates their responses into a single system-level output. A core property of such systems is information asymmetry: agents observe task-specific information, produce intermediate reasoning traces, and operate with different context windows. In isolation, such asymmetry is not problematic, since agents report truthfully to the principal when incentives are fully aligned. However, this assumption breaks down when incentives diverge. Recent evidence suggests that LLM-based agents can acquire their own goals, such as survival or self-preservation, a phenomenon known as scheming, and may deceive humans or other agents. This leads to agency loss: a gap between the principal's intended outcome and the realized system behavior. Drawing on core ideas from microeconomic theory, we argue that these characteristics, information asymmetry and misaligned goals, are best studied through the lens of principal-agent problems. We explain why multi-agent systems, both human-to-LLM and LLM-to-LLM, naturally induce information asymmetry under this formulation, and we use scheming, where LLM agents pursue covert goals, as a concrete case study. We show that recently introduced terminology used to describe scheming, such as covert subversion or deferred subversion, corresponds to well-studied concepts in the mechanism design literature, which not only characterizes the problem but also prescribes concrete mitigation strategies. More broadly, we argue for applying tools developed to study human agent behavior to the analysis of non-human agents.",

We propose MonoScale, an expansion-aware update framework that proactively generates a small set of agent-conditioned familiarization tasks, harvests evidence from both successful and failed interactions, and distills it into auditable natural-language memory to guide future routing. We formalize sequential augmentation as a contextual bandit and perform trust-region memory updates, yielding a monotonic non-decreasing performance guarantee across onboarding rounds.

We introduce Video-o3, a novel framework that supports iterative discovery of salient visual clues, fine-grained inspection of key segments, and adaptive termination once sufficient evidence is acquired. Technically, we address two core challenges in interleaved tool invocation. First, to mitigate attention dispersion induced by the heterogeneity of reasoning and tool-calling, we propose Task-Decoupled Attention Masking, which isolates per-step concentration while preserving shared global context. Second, to control context length growth in multi-turn interactions, we introduce a Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward that balances exploration coverage with reasoning efficiency. To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes. These results demonstrate Video-o3's strong multi-hop evidence-seeking and reasoning capabilities, and validate the effectiveness of native tool invocation in long-video scenarios.",

This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale.\nIn seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL). Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines. Furthermore, SPAN demonstrates superior anytime performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations, suggesting it as a viable, high performance alternative for learning intrinsically efficient policies in resource-limited settings.",

Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges. These results reveal that open-domain video shot retrieval is still a critical capability that multimodal large models have yet to overcome.",

In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner.

Prior work addresses this challenge using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks based on semantic indexing or structure-aware graph analysis, but these approaches incur substantial computational overhead for index construction and maintenance. Motivated by common developer workflows that rely on lightweight search utilities (e.g., ripgrep), we revisit a fundamental yet underexplored question: how far can simple, index-free lexical retrieval support repository-level code completion before more complex retrieval mechanisms become necessary? To answer this question, we systematically investigate lightweight, index-free, intent-aware lexical retrieval through extensive empirical analysis. We first introduce Naive GrepRAG, a baseline framework in which LLMs autonomously generate ripgrep commands to retrieve relevant context. Despite its simplicity, Naive GrepRAG achieves performance comparable to sophisticated graph-based baselines. Further analysis shows that its effectiveness stems from retrieving lexically precise code fragments that are spatially closer to the completion site. We also identify key limitations of lexical retrieval, including sensitivity to noisy matches from high-frequency ambiguous keywords and context fragmentation caused by rigid truncation boundaries. To address these issues, we propose GrepRAG, which augments lexical retrieval with a lightweight post-processing pipeline featuring identifier-weighted re-ranking and structure-aware deduplication. Extensive evaluation on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated demonstrates that GrepRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 7.04-15.58 percent relative improvement in code exact match (EM) over the best baseline on CrossCodeEval.",

Despite this, many LLM-based repair pipelines still operate in a reset-and-solve manner, producing fresh reasoning for every new issue instead of carrying forward what worked in past fixes. This is wasteful because repositories routinely contain earlier issues with overlapping structure, failure modes, or constraints, where prior repair experience could provide useful guidance. Existing approaches typically harvest this signal through forward-time trial procedures, such as repeated refinement or search, incurring high inference cost while still risking divergence from the eventual correct patch. We present an Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation(O-CRD) framework that uses resolved in-repository issues with verified patches as supervision. Starting from a historical fix, the method reconstructs a stage-wise repair trace backward from the verified outcome, then reuses the distilled guidance at inference time to steer file/function localization and patch synthesis, without fine-tuning or online search. On SWE-Bench Lite, this approach increases Pass@1 by 10.4% with GPT-4o, 8.6% with DeepSeek-V3, and 10.3% with GPT-5, indicating that outcome-conditioned reuse of verified repairs can replace costly forward exploration for software issue resolution.",

In this work, we propose TEON, a principled generalization of Muon that extends orthogonalization beyond individual layers by modeling the gradients of a neural network as a structured higher-order tensor. We present TEON's improved convergence guarantee over layer-wise Muon, and further develop a practical instantiation of TEON based on the theoretical analysis with corresponding ablation. We evaluate our approach on two widely adopted architectures: GPT-style models, ranging from 130M to 774M parameters, and LLaMA-style models, ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. Experimental results show that TEON consistently improves training and validation perplexity across model scales and exhibits strong robustness under various approximate SVD schemes.",

Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation. By applying the proposed approach, the agent not only drives in lane but also handles unsafe conditions at an expert level, increasing http://robustness.We make our code publicly available.",

While this formulation enables the use of advanced planning algorithms, these methods typically assume access to supervised reward signals, which are often unavailable in practical scenarios. In this work, we propose UPA, an Unsupervised Prompt Agent that realizes structured search and selection without relying on supervised feedback. Specifically, during search, UPA iteratively constructs an evolving tree structure to navigate the prompt space, guided by fine-grained and order-invariant pairwise comparisons from Large Language Models (LLMs). Crucially, as these local comparisons do not inherently yield a consistent global scale, we decouple systematic prompt exploration from final selection, introducing a two-stage framework grounded in the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model. This framework first performs path-wise Bayesian aggregation of local comparisons to filter candidates under uncertainty, followed by global tournament-style comparisons to infer latent prompt quality and identify the optimal prompt. Experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that UPA consistently outperforms existing prompt optimization methods, showing that agent-style optimization remains highly effective even in fully unsupervised settings.",

We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks.

This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS).

To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments.",

We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control. Our results confirmed that integrated optimization is most beneficial in complex, goal-ambiguous scenarios, and is generalizable across robotic domains requiring goal-directed assistance, advancing the SOTA for adaptive shared autonomy.",

Most classical methods, e.g., Dawid-Skene or (weighted) majority voting, assume annotators are conditionally independent given the true label $Y\\in\\{0,1\\}$, an assumption often violated by LLM judges due to shared data, architectures, prompts, and failure modes. Ignoring such dependencies can yield miscalibrated posteriors and even confidently incorrect predictions. We study label aggregation through a hierarchy of dependence-aware models based on Ising graphical models and latent factors. For class-dependent Ising models, the Bayes log-odds is generally quadratic in votes; for class-independent couplings, it reduces to a linear weighted vote with correlation-adjusted parameters. We present finite-$K$ examples showing that methods based on conditional independence can flip the Bayes label despite matching per-annotator marginals. We prove separation results demonstrating that these methods remain strictly suboptimal as the number of judges grows, incurring nonvanishing excess risk under latent factors.

A line of recent work has studied samplers for discrete diffusion models, such as tau-leaping and Euler solver. However, these samplers require a large number of iterations to control discretization error, since the transition rates are frozen in time and evaluated at the initial state within each time interval. Moreover, theoretical results for these samplers often require boundedness conditions of the transition rate or they focus on a specific type of source distributions. To address those limitations, we establish non-asymptotic discretization error bounds for those samplers without any restriction on transition rates and source distributions, under the framework of discrete flow models. Furthermore, by analyzing a one-step lower bound of the Euler sampler, we propose two corrected samplers: \\textit{time-corrected sampler} and \\textit{location-corrected sampler}, which can reduce the discretization error of tau-leaping and Euler solver with almost no additional computational cost. We rigorously show that the location-corrected sampler has a lower iteration complexity than existing parallel samplers. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by demonstrating improved generation quality and reduced inference time on both simulation and text-to-image generation tasks.

We then examine the basis-expansion approaches, including FlexCode (Izbicki and Lee, 2017) and DeepCDE (Dalmasso et al., 2020), which convert conditional density estimation into a set of nonparametric regression problems.

A systematic numerical comparison of these approaches is provided using a unified evaluation framework that ensures fairness and reproducibility.

In this work, we propose a novel streaming ASR approach that integrates a read/write policy network with monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) to dynamically segment speech embeddings. These segments are interleaved with label sequences during training, enabling seamless integration with the LLM. During inference, the audio stream is buffered until the MoChA module triggers a read signal, at which point the buffered segment together with the previous token is fed into the LLM for the next token prediction. We also introduce a minimal-latency training objective to guide the policy network toward accurate segmentation boundaries. Furthermore, we adopt a joint training strategy in which a non-streaming LLM-ASR model and our streaming model share parameters. Experiments on the AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 Mandarin benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms recent streaming ASR baselines, achieving character error rates of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively. The latency optimization results in a 62.5% reduction in average token generation delay with negligible impact on recognition accuracy",

        "abstract": "Achieving precise and controllable emotional expression is crucial for producing natural and context-appropriate speech in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, many emotion-aware TTS systems, including large language model (LLM)-based designs, rely on scaling fixed emotion embeddings or external guidance, limiting their ability to model emotion-specific latent characteristics. To address this gap, we present EmoShift, a lightweight activation-steering framework incorporating a EmoSteer layer, which learns a steering vector for each target emotion in the output embedding space to capture its latent offset and maintain stable, appropriate expression across utterances and categories. With only 10M trainable parameters,less than 1/30 of full fine-tuning, EmoShift outperforms zero-shot and fully fine-tuned baselines in objective and subjective evaluations, enhancing emotional expressiveness while preserving naturalness and speaker similarity. Further analysis confirms the proposed EmoSteer layer's effectiveness and reveals its potential for controllable emotional intensity in speech synthesis.",

We evaluate \\textit{OneFlowSBI} on ten benchmark inference problems and two high-dimensional real-world inverse problems across multiple simulation budgets. \\textit{OneFlowSBI} is shown to deliver competitive performance against state-of-the-art generalized inference solvers and specialized posterior estimators, while enabling efficient sampling with few ODE integration steps and remaining robust under noisy and partially observed data.",

        "abstract": "In the era of transformer models, masked self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a foundational training paradigm. A defining feature of masked SSL is that training aggregates predictions across many masking patterns, giving rise to a joint, matrix-valued predictor rather than a single vector-valued estimator. This object encodes how coordinates condition on one another and poses new analytical challenges. We develop a precise high-dimensional analysis of masked modeling objectives in the proportional regime where the number of samples scales with the ambient dimension. Our results provide explicit expressions for the generalization error and characterize the spectral structure of the learned predictor, revealing how masked modeling extracts structure from data. For spiked covariance models, we show that the joint predictor undergoes a Baik--Ben Arous--PÃ©chÃ© (BBP)-type phase transition, identifying when masked SSL begins to recover latent signals. Finally, we identify structured regimes in which masked self-supervised learning provably outperforms PCA, highlighting potential advantages of SSL objectives over classical unsupervised methods",

Recent work casts training-free conditional generation in flow models as an optimal control problem; however, solving the resulting trajectory optimisation is computationally and memory intensive, requiring differentiation through the flow dynamics or adjoint solves. We propose MPC-Flow, a model predictive control framework that formulates inverse problem solving with flow-based generative models as a sequence of control sub-problems, enabling practical optimal control-based guidance at inference time. We provide theoretical guarantees linking MPC-Flow to the underlying optimal control objective and show how different algorithmic choices yield a spectrum of guidance algorithms, including regimes that avoid backpropagation through the generative model trajectory. We evaluate MPC-Flow on benchmark image restoration tasks, spanning linear and non-linear settings such as in-painting, deblurring, and super-resolution, and demonstrate strong performance and scalability to massive state-of-the-art architectures via training-free guidance of FLUX.2 (32B) in a quantised setting on consumer hardware.",
