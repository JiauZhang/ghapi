        "abstract": "In e-commerce platforms, search relevance directly influences both user experience and merchant revenue. In multi-country deployments, diverse linguistic, cultural, and product catalog contexts introduce significant distribution shifts, posing substantial challenges to relevance modeling. Existing approaches typically enhance the reasoning or multilingual abilities of a single monolithic model, yet they remain limited by data diversity, coverage gaps, and high inference costs in heterogeneous environments. Our empirical analysis reveals that different LLM base models exhibit complementary strengths across languages and regions, motivating an expert-based architecture. We propose a scalable LLM-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that dynamically routes queries to specialized experts and fuses their embeddings through concatenation. Among rule-based, pseudo-label-based, and fully end-to-end strategies, end-to-end hard routing with concatenation offers the best balance of effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate inference overhead, we further develop an engineering-optimized offline batch pipeline with resource-efficient scheduling, which hides memory latency, improves GPU utilization, and reduces GPU-hour consumption by up to 35% compared with synchronous execution. On datasets spanning six Southeast Asian markets, our MoE improves AUC by 0.72 percentage points over a dense baseline with the same active parameters. Meanwhile, the optimized pipeline achieves 27.6 queries per second (QPS), a 9% throughput improvement. These results demonstrate superior multilingual relevance and efficiency, delivering strong cost-effectiveness for real-world e-commerce search systems.",

        "abstract": "The attribution technique enhances the credibility of LLMs by adding citations to the generated sentences, enabling users to trace back to the original sources and verify the reliability of the output. However, existing instruction-tuned attributed LLMs often fail to properly interpret the contextual semantics of citation symbols (e.g., [i]) during text generation. This shortcoming arises from their insufficient awareness of the context information surrounding citation markers, which in turn leads to disjointed references and poor integration of retrieved knowledge into the generated content. To address this issue, we propose a novel \\textbf{C}ontextual-aware \\textbf{C}itation generation framework (\\textbf{C$^2$}-\\textbf{Cite}) that explicitly integrates the semantic relationships between citation markers and their referenced content. Specifically, a contextual citation alignment mechanism is adopted: it first encodes the retrieved document contexts into the symbol representation of citations, then aligns the marker numbers by decoding information from a citation router function. This mechanism enables the transformation of citation markers from generic placeholders into active knowledge pointers that link to the referenced source information. Experimental results on the ALCE benchmark across three datasets validate our framework C$^2$-Cite++: it outperforms the SOTA baseline by an average of 5.8\\% in citation quality and 17.4\\% in response correctness.

This limitation, analogous to cognitive functional fixedness, prevents agents from restructuring their approach, leading them to pursue unworkable solutions. To address this, we propose PPoGA (Predictive Plan-on-Graph with Action), a novel KGQA framework inspired by human cognitive control and problem-solving. PPoGA incorporates a Planner-Executor architecture to separate high-level strategy from low-level execution and leverages a Predictive Processing mechanism to anticipate outcomes. The core innovation of our work is a self-correction mechanism that empowers the agent to perform not only Path Correction for local execution errors but also Plan Correction by identifying, discarding, and reformulating the entire plan when it proves ineffective. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging multi-hop KGQA benchmarks: GrailQA, CWQ, and WebQSP. The results demonstrate that PPoGA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our work highlights the critical importance of metacognitive abilities like problem restructuring for building more robust and flexible AI reasoning systems.",

Conventional manual approaches, although methodologically systematic, are resource-intensive and susceptible to subjectivity, whereas heuristic and automated techniques frequently under-perform in recall unless supplemented by extensive expert input. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chained prompt engineering framework for the automated development of search strategies in systematic reviews. The framework replicates the procedural structure of manual search design while leveraging LLMs to decompose review objectives, extract and formalize PICO elements, generate conceptual representations, expand terminologies, and synthesize Boolean queries. In addition to query construction, the framework exhibits superior performance in generating well-structured PICO elements relative to existing methods, thereby strengthening the foundation for high-recall search strategies. Evaluation on a subset of the LEADSInstruct dataset demonstrates that the framework attains a 0.9 average recall. These results significantly exceed the performance of existing approaches. Error analysis further highlights the critical role of precise objective specification and terminological alignment in optimizing retrieval effectiveness. These findings confirm the capacity of LLM-based pipelines to yield transparent, reproducible, and high-performing search strategies, and highlight their potential as scalable instruments for supporting evidence synthesis and evidence-based practice.",

Our results demonstrate that G-MemLLM significantly enhances multi-hop reasoning and relational precision, achieving a 13.3\\% accuracy boost on ZsRE for Llama 3.1-8B, and it also yields improvements across model scales, boosting Answer F1 by 8.56 points for GPT-2 and increasing Supporting Fact F1 by 6.89 points for Llama 3.1-8B on HotpotQA.",

However, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations. First, constructing and maintaining knowledge graphs for educational content largely depends on manual curation, resulting in high cost and poor scalability. Second, most personalized education systems lack effective support for state-aware and systematic reasoning over learners' knowledge, and therefore rely on static question banks with limited adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Generative GraphRAG framework for automated knowledge modeling and personalized exercise generation. It consists of two core modules. The first module, Automated Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Constructor (Auto-HKG), leverages LLMs to automatically construct hierarchical knowledge graphs that capture structured concepts and their semantic relations from educational resources. The second module, Cognitive GraphRAG (CG-RAG), performs graph-based reasoning over a learner mastery graph and combines it with retrieval-augmented generation to produce personalized exercises that adapt to individual learning states. The proposed framework has been deployed in real-world educational scenarios, where it receives favorable user feedback, suggesting its potential to support practical personalized education systems.",

However, the optimal operation of HMES remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-physics coupled dynamics of hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS) (consisting of electrolyters, fuel cells and hydrogen tanks) as well as the presence of multiple uncertainties from supply and demand. To address these challenges, this paper develops a comprehensive operational model for HMES that fully captures the nonlinear dynamics and multi-physics process of HESS. Moreover, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework by integrating the emerging representation learning techniques, enabling substantially accelerated and improved policy optimization for spatially and temporally coupled complex networked systems, which is not provided by conventional DRL. Experimental studies based on real-world datasets show that the comprehensive model is crucial to ensure the safe and reliable of HESS. In addition, the proposed SR-DRL approaches demonstrate superior convergence rate and performance over conventional DRL counterparts in terms of reducing the operation cost of HMES and handling the system operating constraints. Finally, we provide some insights into the role of representation learning in DRL, speculating that it can reorganize the original state space into a well-structured and cluster-aware geometric representation, thereby smoothing and facilitating the learning process of DRL.",

Recent advances in agentic AI, especially in structured reasoning and tool use, offer a better way to exploit open and locally deployed tools and LLMs. This paper presents ELLMPEG, an edge-enabled agentic LLM framework for the automated generation of video-processing commands. ELLMPEG integrates tool-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with iterative self-reflection to produce and locally verify executable FFmpeg and VVenC commands directly at the edge, eliminating reliance on external cloud APIs. To evaluate ELLMPEG, we collect a dedicated prompt dataset comprising 480 diverse queries covering different categories of FFmpeg and the Versatile Video Codec (VVC) encoder (VVenC) commands. We validate command generation accuracy and evaluate four open-source LLMs based on command validity, tokens generated per second, inference time, and energy efficiency. We also execute the generated commands to assess their runtime correctness and practical applicability. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5, when augmented with the ELLMPEG framework, achieves an average command-generation accuracy of 78 % with zero recurring API cost, outperforming all other open-source models across both the FFmpeg and VVenC datasets.",

This work introduces an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to support the three canonical phases of disaster response: initial rescue, mid-term recovery, and long-term reconstruction. To achieve robust multimodal grounding, we construct a hierarchical knowledge base that integrates textual disaster manuals, historical lessons (e.g., the 2011 Tohoku earthquake), and both aerial and ground-level imagery. Our system builds on the open-source multimodal implementation, which processes 46 tsunami-related PDFs (2,378 pages) using BLIP-based image captioning, ColVBERT embeddings, and long-context summarization to generate an efficient, structured multimodal retrieval tree optimized for disaster knowledge preservation. An agentic controller dynamically selects retrieval strategies (e.g., RAPTOR, ColBERT) through entropy-aware scene abstraction, enabling adaptive reasoning across heterogeneous inputs. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based post-training method injects experiential knowledge from past disasters, enhancing the models' capacity to support both expert and non-expert responders. Experiments on real disaster datasets demonstrate improved situational grounding, enhanced task decomposition accuracy, and superior usability for emergency operations. Incorporating recent advances in long-context RAG systems, agentic information retrieval, and contemporary emergency response AI, our system achieves substantial gains through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation with self-reasoning and multimodal chain-of-thought capabilities.",

We address this by proposing an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) framework in which independent PPO agents, one per service, plan routes in parallel and commit resource deltas to a shared global resource environment. This coordination by state preserves feasibility across services and enables specialization for service-specific objectives. We evaluate the method on an O-RAN like network simulation using nearly real-time traffic data from the city of Montreal. We compared against a single-agent PPO baseline. AMARL achieves a similar Grade of Service (acceptance rate) (GoS) and end-to-end latency, with reduced training wall-clock time and improved robustness to demand shifts.

        "abstract": "The safety mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) exhibit notable fragility, as even fine-tuning on datasets without harmful content may still undermine their safety capabilities. Meanwhile, existing safety alignment methods predominantly rely on the fine-tuning process, which inadvertently leads to the increased complexity and computational resources required. To address these issues, we introduce LSSF, a novel safety re-alignment framework with \\underline{L}ow-Rank \\underline{S}afety \\underline{S}ubspace \\underline{F}usion. Our proposed method exploits the low-rank characteristics of safety information in LLMs by constructing a low-rank projection matrix to extract the principal components of safety vectors. Notably, this projection matrix represents the low-rank safety subspace of the LLMs, which we have observed to remain stable during fine-tuning process and is isolated from the model's general capabilities. These principal components are used to effectively restore safety alignment when combined with fine-tuned LLMs through linear arithmetic. Additionally, to account for the varying encoding densities of safety information across different layers of LLMs, we propose a novel metric called safety singular value entropy. This metric quantifies the encoding density and allows for the dynamic computation of the safety-critical rank for each safety vector. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed post-hoc alignment method can effectively restore the safety alignment of fine-tuned models with minimal impact on their performance in downstream tasks.",

However, it remains unclear whether such diagnostics generalize across languages and cultural contexts. We extend the Beacon single-turn forced-choice sycophancy diagnostic to Hindi through a controlled three-condition design: English original, Hindi literal translation, and Hindi culturally adapted prompts. We evaluate four open-weight instruction-tuned models on 50 prompts per condition, enabling separation of language encoding effects from cultural adaptation effects. Across all models, sycophancy rates are consistently higher for culturally adapted Hindi prompts than for English, with absolute differences ranging from 12.0 to 16.0 percentage points. A decomposition on Qwen 2.5-Coder-7B shows that cultural adaptation (delta = 14.0%, 95% CI: [4.0%, 26.0%]) accounts for the majority of this gap, while language encoding contributes minimally (delta = 2.0%, 95% CI: [0.0%, 6.0%]). Category-level analysis reveals that advice prompts exhibit the largest cross-lingual differences (20-25 percentage points), achieving statistical significance in two of four models. These findings indicate that alignment behaviors measured in English may not transfer uniformly across languages and that culturally grounded prompt framing plays a substantial role.

Our RAG process was measured as more accurate (87.8%) than standalone LLMs with fine-tuned prompts (62.6%) against expert-supported reference annotations.

Our empirical analysis reveals two key observations: 1) Model performance deteriorates quickly as the number of constraints in the user intent increases, and 2) While user intent does influence the model's logits, such an influence may not be strong enough to effectively steer the decoding process. To this end, we propose Intent-Amplified Code Generation (IntentCoding), a novel decoding strategy that enhances an LLM's ability to follow user intent. IntentCoding captures the influence of user intent by masking out the intent, and applies a multi-strength ensemble mechanism to amplify the effect of user intent during generation. IntentCoding is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and integrates seamlessly with existing decoding procedures. To enable systematic evaluation, we also construct CodeConstraints, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to test user intent compliance under varying numbers of constraints. Experiments on our constructed Constraints, as well as popular IFEvalCode, HumanEval and LiveCodeBench datasets, show that our IntentCoding model significantly improves both constraint satisfaction and functional correctness compared to standard decoding approaches. IntentCoding achieves up to 71.0% relative improvement on CodeConstraints, achieves up to 67.3% relative improvement on IFEvalCode and achieves up to 29.3% relative improvement in pass@1 on HumanEval and LiveCodeBench compared with greedy decoding.",

It explicitly decomposes each node into modality-specific components and assigns relation-aware experts to process heterogeneous message flows, thereby preserving structural information and multimodal semantics while mitigating the undesirable mixing effects commonly observed in general-purpose GNNs. Extensive experiments on three multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that NSG-MoE consistently surpasses strong baselines. Despite incorporating MoE -- which is typically computationally heavy -- our method achieves competitive training efficiency. Beyond empirical results, we provide a spectral analysis revealing that NSG performs adaptive filtering over modality-specific subspaces, thus explaining its disentangling behavior. Furthermore, an information-theoretic analysis shows that the architectural constraints imposed by NSG reduces mutual information between data and parameters and improving generalization capability.",

As LLMs are deployed for adaptive testing and personalized tutoring, this question becomes urgent -- yet we cannot answer it with existing resources. Current educational datasets provide only question identifiers and binary correctness labels, rendering them opaque to LLMs that reason in natural language. We address this gap with FoundationalASSIST, the first English educational dataset providing the complete information needed for research on LLMs in education: full question text, actual student responses (not just right/wrong), records of which wrong answers students chose, and alignment to Common Core K-12 standards. These 1.7 million interactions from 5,000 students enable research directions that were previously impossible to pursue, from fine-tuning student models to analyzing misconception patterns. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we evaluate four frontier models (GPT-OSS-120B, Llama-3.3-70B, Qwen3-Next-80B variants) on two complementary task families: Knowledge Tracing, testing whether LLMs can predict student performance on questions, and the exact answer a student will give; and \\textbf{Pedagogical Grounding}, testing whether LLMs understand the properties that make assessment items effective. Our evaluation reveals significant gaps in current LLM capabilities. Every model barely achieves a trivial baseline on knowledge tracing. All models fall below random chance on item discrimination, indicating that LLMs do not understand what makes one problem more diagnostic than another. Models do show competence at judging relative difficulty (up to 68.6%), but this partial success only highlights the gaps elsewhere. These results establish that substantial advances are needed before LLMs can reliably support personalized learning at scale.

To resolve this tension, we introduce CARE-RFT (Confidence-Anchored Regularized Reinforcement Finetuning), a novel method that replaces standard reverse KL regularization with a skew reverse KL divergence. CARE-RFT provides a confidence-sensitive penalty: it is bounded for confident, consistently rewarded explorations to enable reasoning, while unbounded elsewhere to preserve calibration. Extensive experiments across multiple model scales and RFT algorithms show that CARE-RFT achieves a superior balance, matching the reasoning performance of unconstrained RFT while recovering the trustworthiness and calibration of the base model.

STM transforms continuous time series values into symbol tokens with quantization techniques based on human cognitive structures, and captures temporal dynamics through structured transformations of symbols, enabling fast engineering based predictions in which language models focus on critical parts of time series data. STM is a general purpose mechanisms that ensure the integrity of backbone language models, but they significantly improve their efficiency by inferring the dynamic and structured patterns inherent in time series data. We evaluated STM on various time series datasets, paired with four small language models (SLM) with limited computational environments. For all models, STM achieves error reductions of up to 69% in MAE and 90% in MSE compared to the default backbone SLM without STM. These results demonstrate the potential of STM as an efficient, adaptable layer for symbol-driven time series prediction using foundation models. The accuracy improvements were made at negligible resource costs, with maximum GPU memory of the base model increasing by approximately 0.06% and latency overhead increasing by only 0.64%.",

Findings reveal that most systems are fully automated, embedded within online platforms, and primarily focused on error detection and code correctness. While recent developments incorporate adaptive features and large language models to enable more personalized and interactive feedback, few systems offer support for higher-order learning processes, interactive components, or learner agency. Moreover, evaluation practices tend to emphasize short-term performance gains, with limited attention to long-term outcomes or instructional integration.

        "abstract": "We introduce a black-box interpretability framework that learns a verifiable constitution: a natural language summary of how changes to a prompt affect a model's specific behavior, such as its alignment, correctness, or adherence to constraints. Our method leverages atomic concept edits (ACEs), which are targeted operations that add, remove, or replace an interpretable concept in the input prompt. By systematically applying ACEs and observing the resulting effects on model behavior across various tasks, our framework learns a causal mapping from edits to predictable outcomes. This learned constitution provides deep, generalizable insights into the model. Empirically, we validate our approach across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and text-to-image alignment, for controlling and understanding model behavior. We found that for text-to-image generation, GPT-Image tends to focus on grammatical adherence, while Imagen 4 prioritizes atmospheric coherence. In mathematical reasoning, distractor variables confuse GPT-5 but leave Gemini 2.5 models and o4-mini largely unaffected. Moreover, our results show that the learned constitutions are highly effective for controlling model behavior, achieving an average of 1.86 times boost in success rate over methods that do not use constitutions.",

However, accurately interpreting unconstrained STEM student handwritten solutions with intertwined mathematical formulas, diagrams, and textual reasoning poses a significant challenge due to the lack of authentic and domain-specific benchmarks. Additionally, current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on the outcomes of downstream tasks (e.g., auto-grading), which often probe only a subset of the recognized content, thereby failing to capture the MLLMs' understanding of complex handwritten logic as a whole. To bridge this gap, we release EDU-CIRCUIT-HW, a dataset consisting of 1,300+ authentic student handwritten solutions from a university-level STEM course. Utilizing the expert-verified verbatim transcriptions and grading reports of student solutions, we simultaneously evaluate various MLLMs' upstream recognition fidelity and downstream auto-grading performance. Our evaluation uncovers an astonishing scale of latent failures within MLLM-recognized student handwritten content, highlighting the models' insufficient reliability for auto-grading and other understanding-oriented applications in high-stakes educational settings. In solution, we present a case study demonstrating that leveraging identified error patterns to preemptively detect and rectify recognition errors, with only minimal human intervention (approximately 4% of the total solutions), can significantly enhance the robustness of the deployed AI-enabled grading system on unseen student solutions.",

We present Simulate Anything, a graphics-driven world modeling and simulation framework that enables efficient generation of high-fidelity embodied training data using only multi-view environment videos and off-the-shelf assets. Our approach reconstructs real-world environments into a photorealistic scene representation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), seamlessly capturing fine-grained geometry and appearance from video. We then leverage generative models to recover a physically realistic representation and integrate it into a simulation environment via a precision calibration target, enabling accurate scale alignment between the reconstructed scene and the real world. Together, these components provide a unified, editable, and physically grounded world model. Vision Language Action (VLA) models trained on our simulated data achieve strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, matching or even surpassing results obtained with real-world data, highlighting the potential of reconstruction-driven world modeling for scalable and practical embodied intelligence training.",

A deep fusion network for multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction, termed the Multi-Modal Deep Fusion Framework, is designed. The overall architecture consists of two modality-specific feature extraction networks and a bidirectional cross-attention fusion module, aiming to fully exploit the complementary information of LiDAR and radar point clouds in spatial geometric structure and dynamic reflection characteristics. In the feature extraction stage, the model employs independent but structurally identical feature encoders for LiDAR and radar. After feature extraction, the model enters the Bidirectional Cross-Attention Mechanism stage to achieve information complementarity and semantic alignment between the two modalities. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the MMAUD dataset used in the CVPR 2024 UG2+ UAV Tracking and Pose-Estimation Challenge is adopted as the training and testing dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-modal fusion model significantly improves trajectory prediction accuracy, achieving a 40% improvement compared to the baseline model. In addition, ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of different loss functions and post-processing strategies in improving model performance. The proposed model can effectively utilize multi-modal data and provides an efficient solution for unauthorized UAV trajectory prediction in the low-altitude economy.",

Furthermore, many systems return black-box predictions that are difficult to audit or reproduce. Leveraging recent advances in tool LLMs, this study proposes a conversational, code-generating agent that transforms natural-language queries into executable, auditable Python workflows. The agent operates over a unified easily extendable API for classification, segmentation, detection (oriented bounding boxes), spectral indices, and geospatial operators. With our proposed framework, it is possible to control the results at three levels: (i) tool-level performance on public EO benchmarks; (ii) at the agent-level to understand the capacity to generate valid, hallucination-free code; and (iii) at the task-level on specific use cases. In this work, we select two use-cases of interest: land-composition mapping and post-wildfire damage assessment. The proposed agent outperforms general-purpose LLM/VLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaVA), achieving 64.2% vs. 51.7% accuracy on land-composition and 50% vs. 0% on post-wildfire analysis, while producing results that are transparent and easy to interpret.

Nevertheless, an important yet insufficiently explored research direction remains visual document image editing, which involves modifying textual content within images while faithfully preserving the original text style and background context. Existing approaches, including AnyText, GlyphControl, and TextCtrl, predominantly focus on English-language scenarios and documents with relatively sparse textual layouts, thereby failing to adequately address dense, structurally complex documents or non-Latin scripts such as Chinese. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{V}isual \\textbf{D}oc \\textbf{E}dit Bench(VDE Bench), a rigorously human-annotated and evaluated benchmark specifically designed to assess image editing models on multilingual and complex visual document editing tasks. The benchmark comprises a high-quality dataset encompassing densely textual documents in both English and Chinese, including academic papers, posters, presentation slides, examination materials, and newspapers. Furthermore, we introduce a decoupled evaluation framework that systematically quantifies editing performance at the OCR parsing level, enabling fine-grained assessment of text modification accuracy. Based on this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative state-of-the-art image editing models. Manual verification demonstrates a strong consistency between human judgments and automated evaluation metrics.

In ALIGN, a principal delegates a task to multiple agents that generate candidate solutions under designed incentives, and then selects among their outputs to produce a final answer. This formulation induces structured interaction among agents while preserving alignment between agent and principal objectives. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that, under a fair comparison with equal access to candidate solutions, ALIGN provably improves expected performance over single-agent generation.

These findings replicate across ImageNet and CIFAR-10, and generalize to NLP: effective dimension predicts performance for 8 encoder models on SST-2/MNLI and 15 decoder-only LLMs on AG News (r=0.69, p=0.004), while model size does not (r=0.07). We establish bidirectional causality: degrading geometry via noise causes accuracy loss (r=-0.94, $p < 10^(-9)$), while improving geometry via PCA maintains accuracy across architectures (-0.03pp at 95% variance). This relationship is noise-type agnostic -- Gaussian, Uniform, Dropout, and Salt-and-pepper noise all show $|r| > 0.90$.

To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic-aware C\\&C transmission for multi-UAVs under limited wireless resources. Specifically, we leverage semantic similarity to measure the variation in C\\&C messages for each UAV over continuous transmission time intervals (TTIs) and capture the correlation of C\\&C messages among UAVs, enabling multicast transmission. Based on the semantic similarity and the importance of UAV commands, we design a trigger function to quantify the QoS of UAVs. Then, to maximize the long-term QoS and exploit multicast opportunities of C\\&C messages induced by semantic similarity, we develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to jointly determine the transmission mode (unicast/multicast/idle) and the allocation of limited resource blocks (RBs) between a base station (BS) and UAVs.

        "abstract": "Predicting physical dynamics from raw visual data remains a major challenge in AI. While recent video generation models have achieved impressive visual quality, they still cannot consistently generate physically plausible videos due to a lack of modeling of physical laws. Recent approaches combining 3D Gaussian splatting and physics engines can produce physically plausible videos, but are hindered by high computational costs in both reconstruction and simulation, and often lack robustness in complex real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce Neural Gaussian Force Field (NGFF), an end-to-end neural framework that integrates 3D Gaussian perception with physics-based dynamic modeling to generate interactive, physically realistic 4D videos from multi-view RGB inputs, achieving two orders of magnitude faster than prior Gaussian simulators. To support training, we also present GSCollision, a 4D Gaussian dataset featuring diverse materials, multi-object interactions, and complex scenes, totaling over 640k rendered physical videos (~4 TB). Evaluations on synthetic and real 3D scenarios show NGFF's strong generalization and robustness in physical reasoning, advancing video prediction towards physics-grounded world models.",

        "abstract": "3-D object detection based on 4-D radar-vision is an important part in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, there are two challenges which need to be faced. First, the 4-D radar point clouds are sparse, leading to poor 3-D representation. Second, vision datas exhibit representation degradation under low-light, long distance detection and dense occlusion scenes, which provides unreliable texture information during fusion stage. To address these issues, a framework named SDCM is proposed, which contains Simulated Densifying and Compensatory Modeling Fusion for radar-vision 3-D object detection in IoV. Firstly, considering point generation based on Gaussian simulation of key points obtained from 3-D Kernel Density Estimation (3-D KDE), and outline generation based on curvature simulation, Simulated Densifying (SimDen) module is designed to generate dense radar point clouds. Secondly, considering that radar data could provide more real time information than vision data, due to the all-weather property of 4-D radar. Radar Compensatory Mapping (RCM) module is designed to reduce the affects of vision datas' representation degradation. Thirdly, considering that feature tensor difference values contain the effective information of every modality, which could be extracted and modeled for heterogeneity reduction and modalities interaction, Mamba Modeling Interactive Fusion (MMIF) module is designed for reducing heterogeneous and achieving interactive Fusion. Experiment results on the VoD, TJ4DRadSet and Astyx HiRes 2019 dataset show that SDCM achieves best performance with lower parameter quantity and faster inference speed. Our code will be available.",

We first formalize inference cost for LRMs and define PI-DoS, then prove that any practical PI-DoS attack should satisfy three properties: (1) a high amplification ratio, where each query induces a disproportionately long reasoning trace relative to its own length; (ii) stealthiness, in which prompts and responses remain on the natural language manifold and evade distribution shift detectors; and (iii) optimizability, in which the attack supports efficient optimization without being slowed by its own success. Under this framework, we present ReasoningBomb, a reinforcement-learning-based PI-DoS framework that is guided by a constant-time surrogate reward and trains a large reasoning-model attacker to generate short natural prompts that drive victim LRMs into pathologically long and often effectively non-terminating reasoning. Across seven open-source models (including LLMs and LRMs) and three commercial LRMs, ReasoningBomb induces 18,759 completion tokens on average and 19,263 reasoning tokens on average across reasoning models. It outperforms the the runner-up baseline by 35% in completion tokens and 38% in reasoning tokens, while inducing 6-7x more tokens than benign queries and achieving 286.7x input-to-output amplification ratio averaged across all samples. Additionally, our method achieves 99.8% bypass rate on input-based detection, 98.7% on output-based detection, and 98.4% against strict dual-stage joint detection.",

Beyond analysis, probes are often used operationally in probe-then-steer pipelines: a learned concept vector is extracted from a probe and injected via additive activation steering by adding it to a layer representation during the forward pass. The effectiveness of this pipeline hinges on estimating concept vectors that are accurate, directionally stable under ablation, and inexpensive to obtain. Motivated by these desiderata, we propose RAPTOR (Ridge-Adaptive Logistic Probe), a simple L2-regularized logistic probe whose validation-tuned ridge strength yields concept vectors from normalized weights. Across extensive experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs and human-written concept datasets, RAPTOR matches or exceeds strong baselines in accuracy while achieving competitive directional stability and substantially lower training cost; these quantitative results are supported by qualitative downstream steering demonstrations. Finally, using the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT), we provide a mechanistic characterization of ridge logistic regression in an idealized Gaussian teacher-student model in the high-dimensional few-shot regime, explaining how penalty strength mediates probe accuracy and concept-vector stability and yielding structural predictions that qualitatively align with trends observed on real LLM embeddings.",

This formulation enables an efficient ranking of a large number of candidate block-removal configurations and yields many high-quality, non-trivial solutions beyond consecutive regions. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art block-removal methods across several benchmarks, with performance gains persisting after short retraining, and reaching improvements of up to 6 points on the MMLU benchmark. Our method requires only forward and backward passes for a few active parameters, together with an (at least approximate) Ising solver, and can be readily applied to any architecture. We illustrate this generality on the recent NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-FP8 model, which exhibits a highly inhomogeneous and challenging block structure.",

Standard uniform quantizers assume that parameters are evenly distributed, an assumption at odds with the highly skewed distributions observed in practice. We propose Benford-Quant, a simple, data-free non-uniform quantizer inspired by Benford's Law, which predicts that leading digits follow a logarithmic distribution. Benford-Quant replaces the uniform grid with a log-spaced codebook, dedicating more resolution to the frequent small-magnitude weights. We provide both theoretical intuition and empirical evidence: (i) weights in transformer transformational layers adhere closely to Benford statistics, while normalization layers systematically deviate; (ii) on Small Language Models (SLMs), Benford-Quant consistently improves perplexity, reducing 4-bit perplexity on Gemma-270M by more than 10%; and (iii) on larger LLMs, it remains competitive, with differences explained by over-parameterization effects. Our results indicate that incorporating a Benford-inspired prior into quantization grids is a low-cost modification that yields accuracy gains in aggressive few-bit regimes. Although it is not able to surpass the state of the art in tasks such as perplexity and LAMBADA, the Benford-Quant approach can be hybridized with other quantization methods-such as SmoothQuant and Activation-Aware Quantization-without major pipeline modification, potentially improving their performance.",

We propose DA-GRPO, a dual-advantage extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization that incorporates cloud-usage constraints directly into advantage computation, avoiding fixed reward shaping and external routing models. This design enables the local model to jointly learn task competence and collaboration behavior, allowing cloud requests to emerge naturally during post-training while respecting a prescribed assistance budget. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that DA-GRPO improves post-switch accuracy, substantially reduces forgetting, and maintains stable cloud usage compared to prior collaborative and routing-based approaches.",

We also observe a second seemingly separate phenomenon: under fixed hyperparameters, the stochastic fine-tuning reward often rises, peaks, and then degrades in both ES and GRPO. We argue that both effects reflect a shared geometric property of fine-tuning landscapes: they are low-dimensional in curvature. A small set of high-curvature dimensions dominates improvement, producing (i) heterogeneous time scales that yield rise-then-decay under fixed stochasticity, as captured by a minimal quadratic stochastic-ascent model, and (ii) degenerate improving updates, where many random perturbations share similar components along these directions. Using ES as a geometric probe on fine-tuning reward landscapes of GSM8K, ARC-C, and WinoGrande across Qwen2.5-Instruct models (0.5B--7B), we show that reward-improving perturbations remain empirically accessible with small populations across scales. Together, these results reconcile ES scalability with non-monotonic training dynamics and suggest that high-dimensional fine-tuning may admit a broader class of viable optimization methods than worst-case theory implies.",

We introduce GASP (Guided Adversarial Self-Play), a robustification method that explicitly trains detect-and-repair capabilities using only outcome verification. Without human labels or external teachers, GASP forms an adversarial self-play game within a single model: a polluter learns to induce failure via locally coherent corruptions, while an agent learns to diagnose and recover under the same corrupted conditioning. To address the scarcity of successful recoveries early in training, we propose in-distribution repair guidance, an imitation term on self-generated repairs that increases recovery probability while preserving previously acquired capabilities. Across four open-weight models (1.5B--8B), GASP transforms strong-but-brittle reasoners into robust ones that withstand misleading and perturbed context while often improving clean accuracy. Further analysis shows that adversarial corruptions induce an effective curriculum, and in-distribution guidance enables rapid recovery learning with minimal representational drift.",

We find that the distributional discrepancy in the denoising process serves as a measurable indicator of how much of the mapping is retained, also reflecting the strength of unlearning. Inspired by this, we propose IVO (Initial Latent Variable Optimization), a concise and powerful attack framework that reactivates these dormant memories by reconstructing the broken mappings. Through Image Inversion}, Adversarial Optimization and Reused Attack, IVO optimizes initial latent variables to realign the noise distribution of unlearned models with their original unsafe states. Extensive experiments across 8 widely used unlearning techniques demonstrate that IVO achieves superior attack success rates and strong semantic consistency, exposing fundamental flaws in current defenses.

To address these concerns, we propose a noise--frequency Continuation framework that constructs a continuous family of intermediate posteriors whose likelihood enforces measurement consistency only within a noise-dependent frequency band. This principle is instantiated with a stabilized posterior sampler that combines a diffusion predictor, band-limited likelihood guidance, and a multi-resolution consistency strategy that aggressively commits reliable coarse corrections while conservatively adopting high-frequency details only when they become identifiable.

To instill this capability, we construct a Large-scale Inference Trajectory Suite comprising 18k SFT reasoning chains and 38k RL feedback samples. Notably, we are the first to employ RL for logical alignment in this domain, ensuring motion inferences are grounded in physical geometry rather than contextual guesswork.

An untrusted operator runs inference on a fixed GPU architecture, signs and encrypts the request and response, and publishes the encrypted log to EigenDA. During a challenge window, any watcher may request re-execution through EigenVerify; the result is then deterministically recomputed inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) with a threshold-released decryption key, allowing a public challenge with private data.

The primary challenge in talking head generation is achieving audio-visual coherence between the lips and the audio, known as lip synchronization. This paper proposes a generic method, LPIPS-AttnWav2Lip, for reconstructing face images of any speaker based on audio. We used the U-Net architecture based on residual CBAM to better encode and fuse audio and visual modal information. Additionally, the semantic alignment module extends the receptive field of the generator network to obtain the spatial and channel information of the visual features efficiently; and match statistical information of visual features with audio latent vector to achieve the adjustment and injection of the audio content information to the visual information. To achieve exact lip synchronization and to generate realistic high-quality images, our approach adopts LPIPS Loss, which simulates human judgment of image quality and reduces instability possibility during the training process. The proposed method achieves outstanding performance in terms of lip synchronization accuracy and visual quality as demonstrated by subjective and objective evaluation results.

        "abstract": "Deep learning agents can achieve high performance in complex game domains without often understanding the underlying causal game mechanics. To address this, we investigate Causal Induction: the ability to infer governing laws from observational data, by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) with reverse-engineering Video Game Description Language (VGDL) rules from gameplay traces. To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules. These learned SCMs can be used for downstream use cases such as causal reinforcement learning, interpretable agents, and procedurally generating novel but logically consistent games.",

Most diffusion-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors exploit score magnitude or local geometry (energies, curvature, covariance spectra) and largely ignore equivariances. We introduce Group-Equivariant Posterior Consistency (GEPC), a training-free probe that measures how consistently the learned score transforms under a finite group $\\mathcal{G}$, detecting equivariance breaking even when score magnitude remains unchanged. At the population level, we propose the ideal GEPC residual, which averages an equivariance-residual functional over $\\mathcal{G}$, and we derive ID upper bounds and OOD lower bounds under mild assumptions. GEPC requires only score evaluations and produces interpretable equivariance-breaking maps. On OOD image benchmark datasets, we show that GEPC achieves competitive or improved AUROC compared to recent diffusion-based baselines while remaining computationally lightweight. On high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery where OOD corresponds to targets or anomalies in clutter, GEPC yields strong target-background separation and visually interpretable equivariance-breaking maps.

However, we observe that current detectors primarily rely on global artifacts that appear as inpainting side effects, rather than on locally synthesized content. We show that this behavior occurs because VAE-based reconstruction induces a subtle but pervasive spectral shift across the entire image, including unedited regions. To isolate this effect, we introduce Inpainting Exchange (INP-X), an operation that restores original pixels outside the edited region while preserving all synthesized content. We create a 90K test dataset including real, inpainted, and exchanged images to evaluate this phenomenon. Under this intervention, pretrained state-of-the-art detectors, including commercial ones, exhibit a dramatic drop in accuracy (e.g., from 91\\% to 55\\%), frequently approaching chance level. We provide a theoretical analysis linking this behavior to high-frequency attenuation caused by VAE information bottlenecks. Our findings highlight the need for content-aware detection. Indeed, training on our dataset yields better generalization and localization than standard inpainting. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/emirhanbilgic/INP-X.",

In particular, we capture the geometry of the loss using a Riemannian metric and leverage a flexible approximate posterior that adapts to the local structure of the loss landscape. This approach allows us to sample generative models that resemble the original model, but exhibit reduced memorisation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces memorisation while preserving generalisation. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis of our method, which explains our findings. Overall, our work illustrates how considering the geometry of the loss enables effective use of the parameter space, even for complex high-dimensional generative models.",

While prior efforts have explored empirical remedies, a theoretical understanding of such performance disparities in classification remains limited. In this work, we present Margin Regularization for Performance Disparity Reduction (MR$^2$), a theoretically principled regularization for classification by dynamically adjusting margins in both the logit and representation spaces. Our analysis establishes a margin-based, class-sensitive generalization bound that reveals how per-class feature variability contributes to error, motivating the use of larger margins for hard classes. Guided by this insight, MR$^2$ optimizes per-class logit margins proportional to feature spread and penalizes excessive representation margins to enhance intra-class compactness. Experiments on seven datasets, including ImageNet, and diverse pre-trained backbones (MAE, MoCov2, CLIP) demonstrate that MR$^2$ not only improves overall accuracy but also significantly boosts hard class performance without trading off easy classes, thus reducing performance disparity.

To better understand LLM scaling, we study representational differences between LLMs and their smaller counterparts, with the goal of replicating the representational qualities of larger models in the smaller models. We observe a geometric phenomenon which we term $\\textbf{embedding condensation}$, where token embeddings collapse into a narrow cone-like subspace in some language models. Through systematic analyses across multiple Transformer families, we show that small models such as $\\texttt{GPT2}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen3-0.6B}$ exhibit severe condensation, whereas the larger models such as $\\texttt{GPT2-xl}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen3-32B}$ are more resistant to this phenomenon. Additional observations show that embedding condensation is not reliably mitigated by knowledge distillation from larger models. To fight against it, we formulate a dispersion loss that explicitly encourages embedding dispersion during training. Experiments demonstrate that it mitigates condensation, recovers dispersion patterns seen in larger models, and yields performance gains across 10 benchmarks. We believe this work offers a principled path toward improving smaller Transformers without additional parameters.",

Despite its advantages, most existing FL-based IDS assume closed-set learning and lack mechanisms such as uncertainty estimation, semantic generalization, and explicit modeling of epistemic ambiguity in zero-day attack scenarios. Additionally, robustness to heterogeneous and unreliable clients remains a challenge in practical applications. This paper introduces a semantics-driven federated IDS framework that incorporates language-derived semantic supervision into federated optimization, enabling open-set and zero-shot intrusion detection for previously unseen attack behaviors. The approach constructs semantic attack prototypes using a Tri-LLM ensemble of GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and LLaMA-3-8B, aligning distributed telemetry features with high-level attack concepts. Inter-LLM semantic disagreement is modeled as epistemic uncertainty for zero-day risk estimation, while a trust-aware aggregation mechanism dynamically weights client updates based on reliability. Experimental results show stable semantic alignment across heterogeneous clients and consistent convergence. The framework achieves over 80% zero-shot detection accuracy on unseen attack patterns, improving zero-day discrimination by more than 10% compared to similarity-based baselines, while maintaining low aggregation instability in the presence of unreliable or compromised clients.",

This overlooks common information-seeking scenarios with multiple plausible answers, where diversity is essential to avoid collapsing to a single dominant response, thereby constraining creativity and compromising fair and inclusive information access. Our analysis reveals a commonly overlooked limitation of standard RAG systems: they underutilize retrieved context diversity, such that increasing retrieval diversity alone does not yield diverse generations. To address this limitation, we propose DIVERGE, a plug-and-play agentic RAG framework with novel reflection-guided generation and memory-augmented iterative refinement, which promotes diverse viewpoints while preserving answer quality. We introduce novel metrics tailored to evaluating the diversity-quality trade-off in open-ended questions, and show that they correlate well with human judgments. We demonstrate that DIVERGE achieves the best diversity-quality trade-off compared to competitive baselines and previous state-of-the-art methods on the real-world Infinity-Chat dataset, substantially improving diversity while maintaining quality. More broadly, our results reveal a systematic limitation of current LLM-based systems for open-ended information-seeking and show that explicitly modeling diversity can mitigate it.

Our empirical analysis reveals that visual attention sinks are functionally heterogeneous, comprising Probability Dumps with low contribution that can be safely pruned, and Structural Anchors with high contribution essential for maintaining model performance. Further, we identify substantial redundancy in Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) associated with visual tokens, particularly in intermediate layers where image tokens exhibit linear behavior. Based on our findings, we introduce CAPA (Contribution-Aware Pruning and FFN Approximation), a dual-strategy framework that prunes visual tokens using attention contribution at critical functional transitions and reduces FFN computation through efficient linear approximations.

We solve these challenges by introducing SANEval (Spatial, Attribute, and Numeracy Evaluation), a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a scalable new pipeline for open-vocabulary compositional evaluation. SANEval combines a large language model (LLM) for deep prompt understanding with an LLM-enhanced, open-vocabulary object detector to robustly evaluate compositional adherence, unconstrained by a fixed vocabulary.

While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \\texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation.

Motivated by this insight, we reformulate panoramic editing directly in the equirectangular projection (ERP) domain and present World-Shaper, a unified geometry-aware framework that bridges panoramic generation and editing within a single editing-centric design. To overcome the scarcity of paired data, we adopt a generate-then-edit paradigm, where controllable panoramic generation serves as an auxiliary stage to synthesize diverse paired examples for supervised editing learning. To address geometric distortion, we introduce a geometry-aware learning strategy that explicitly enforces position-aware shape supervision and implicitly internalizes panoramic priors through progressive training. Extensive experiments on our new benchmark, PEBench, demonstrate that our method achieves superior geometric consistency, editing fidelity, and text controllability compared to SOTA methods, enabling coherent and flexible 360Â° visual world creation with unified editing control.

However, current state-of-the-art models often alter object details, omit or duplicate objects, and produce layouts with incorrect relative sizing or inconsistent item presentations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PLACID, a framework that transforms a collection of object images into an appealing multi-object composite. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we leverage a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) diffusion model with text control to preserve objects consistency, identities, and background details by exploiting temporal priors from videos. Second, we propose a novel data curation strategy that generates synthetic sequences where randomly placed objects smoothly move to their target positions. This synthetic data aligns with the video model's temporal priors during training. At inference, objects initialized at random positions consistently converge into coherent layouts guided by text, with the final frame serving as the composite image. Extensive quantitative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that PLACID surpasses state-of-the-art methods in multi-object compositing, achieving superior identity, background, and color preservation, with less omitted objects and visually appealing results.",

However, recent work has shown that such pipelines suffer from severe temporal drift, where errors accumulate and amplify over long horizons. We hypothesize that this drift does not primarily stem from insufficient model capacity, but rather from inference-time error propagation. Specifically, we contend that drift arises from the uncontrolled reuse of corrupted latent conditioning tokens during auto-regressive inference. To correct this accumulation of errors, we propose a simple, inference-time method that mitigates temporal drift by identifying and removing unstable latent tokens before they are reused for conditioning. For this purpose, we define unstable tokens as latent tokens whose representations deviate significantly from those of the previously generated batch, indicating potential corruption or semantic drift. By explicitly removing corrupted latent tokens from the auto-regressive context, rather than modifying entire spatial regions or model parameters, our method prevents unreliable latent information from influencing future generation steps. As a result, it significantly improves long-horizon temporal consistency without modifying the model architecture, training procedure, or leaving latent space.",

Our studies, as well as prior work, show that LLM-generated plans routinely violate domain constraints given in their instructions (e.g., walking through walls). To address this failure, we propose iteratively augmenting instructions with Localized In-Context Learning (L-ICL) demonstrations: targeted corrections for specific failing steps. Specifically, L-ICL identifies the first constraint violation in a trace and injects a minimal input-output example giving the correct behavior for the failing step. Our proposed technique of L-ICL is much effective than explicit instructions or traditional ICL, which adds complete problem-solving trajectories, and many other baselines. For example, on an 8x8 gridworld, L-ICL produces valid plans 89% of the time with only 60 training examples, compared to 59% for the best baseline, an increase of 30%. L-ICL also shows dramatic improvements in other domains (gridworld navigation, mazes, Sokoban, and BlocksWorld), and on several LLM architectures.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale training systems typically use synchronous training, requiring all GPUs to be healthy simultaneously. In our experience training on O(100K) GPUs, synchronous training results in a low efficiency due to frequent failures and long recovery time.\nTo address this problem, we propose a novel training paradigm, Fault Tolerant Hybrid-Shared Data Parallelism (FT-HSDP). FT-HSDP uses data parallel replicas as units of fault tolerance. When failures occur, only a single data-parallel replica containing the failed GPU or server is taken offline and restarted, while the other replicas continue training. To realize this idea at scale, FT-HSDP incorporates several techniques: 1) We introduce a Fault Tolerant All Reduce (FTAR) protocol for gradient exchange across data parallel replicas. FTAR relies on the CPU to drive the complex control logic for tasks like adding or removing participants dynamically, and relies on GPU to perform data transfer for best performance. 2) We introduce a non-blocking catch-up protocol, allowing a recovering replica to join training with minimal stall.\nCompared with fully synchronous training at O(100K) GPUs, FT-HSDP can reduce the stall time due to failure recovery from 10 minutes to 3 minutes, increasing effective training time from 44\\% to 80\\%. We further demonstrate that FT-HSDP's asynchronous recovery does not bring any meaning degradation to the accuracy of the result model.",

Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is critical for the trustworthy uptake of generated answers. Existing UQ approaches remain weakly validated in scientific QA, a domain relying on fact-retrieval and reasoning capabilities. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating UQ metrics in reasoning-demanding QA studying calibration of UQ methods, providing an extensible open-source framework to reproducibly assess calibration. Our study spans up to 20 large language models of base, instruction-tuned and reasoning variants. Our analysis covers seven scientific QA datasets, including both multiple-choice and arithmetic question answering tasks, using prompting to emulate an open question answering setting. We evaluate and compare methods representative of prominent approaches on a total of 685,000 long-form responses, spanning different reasoning complexities representative of domain-specific tasks. At the token level, we find that instruction tuning induces strong probability mass polarization, reducing the reliability of token-level confidences as estimates of uncertainty. Models further fine-tuned for reasoning are exposed to the same effect, but the reasoning process appears to mitigate it depending on the provider. At the sequence level, we show that verbalized approaches are systematically biased and poorly correlated with correctness, while answer frequency (consistency across samples) yields the most reliable calibration. In the wake of our analysis, we study and report the misleading effect of relying exclusively on ECE as a sole measure for judging performance of UQ methods on benchmark datasets. Our findings expose critical limitations of current UQ methods for LLMs and standard practices in benchmarking thereof.",

Our analysis yields three key insights: (1) The benefits of Easy-First decoding (prioritizing low-entropy tokens) are magnified as model error increases; (2) factorized parallel decoding introduces intrinsic sampling errors that can lead to arbitrary large Reverse KL divergence, capturing \"incoherence\" failures that standard Forward KL metrics overlook; and (3) while verification can eliminate sampling error, it incurs an exponential cost governed by the total correlation within a block.

We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%). These results demonstrate that even frontier models rely heavily on static visual shortcuts rather than genuine temporal logic, positioning TimeBlind as a vital diagnostic tool for next-generation video understanding.

To help address this issue, we show that self-attention is efficiently computable to arbitrary precision with constant cost per token, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in memory use and computation. We derive our formulation by decomposing the conventional formulation's Taylor expansion into expressions over symmetric chains of tensor products. We exploit their symmetry to obtain feed-forward transformations that efficiently map queries and keys to coordinates in a minimal polynomial-kernel feature basis. Notably, cost is fixed inversely in proportion to head size, enabling application over a greater number of heads per token than otherwise feasible. We implement our formulation and empirically validate its correctness. Our work enables unbounded token generation at modest fixed cost, substantially reducing the infrastructure and energy demands of large-scale Transformer models.

In this work, we introduce RAGRouter-Bench, the first dataset and benchmark designed for adaptive RAG routing. RAGRouter-Bench revisits retrieval from a query-corpus compatibility perspective and standardizes five representative RAG paradigms for systematic evaluation across 7,727 queries and 21,460 documents spanning diverse domains. The benchmark incorporates three canonical query types together with fine-grained semantic and structural corpus metrics, as well as a unified evaluation for both generation quality and resource consumption. Experiments with DeepSeek-V3 and LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that no single RAG paradigm is universally optimal, that paradigm applicability is strongly shaped by query-corpus interactions, and that increased advanced mechanism does not necessarily yield better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. These findings underscore the necessity of routing-aware evaluation and establish a foundation for adaptive, interpretable, and generalizable next-generation RAG systems.",

However, our work shows that LLMs tend to rely on inherent linguistic patterns, which can override contextual information encoded in the hidden representations during decoding. For example, even when a hidden representation encodes the contextual attribute \"purple\" for \"broccoli\", LLMs still generate \"green\" in their explanations, reflecting a strong prior association. This behavior reveals a systematic unfaithfulness in Patchscopes. To systematically study this issue, we first designed a dataset to evaluate the faithfulness of Patchscopes under biased cases, and our results show that there is an 18.84\\% faithfulness decrease on average. We then propose Bias Alignment through Logit Recalibration (BALOR), which treats the output logits from an unpatched prompt as capturing model bias and contrasts them with logits obtained under patched contextual information. By recalibrating the logit distribution through this contrast, BALOR suppresses model bias and amplifies contextual information during generation. Experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that BALOR consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving up to 33\\% relative performance improvement.",

Across models, we observe a systemic failure of semantic invariant adversarial transformations: even state-of-the-art vulnerability detectors perform well on clean inputs while predictions flip under behavior-equivalent edits. Universal adversarial strings optimized on a single surrogate model remain effective when transferred to black-box APIs, and gradient access can further amplify evasion success.

These systems must perform reliably not only under ideal conditions, but also when challenged by natural and adversarial driving factors. Both of these types of interference can lead to perception errors and delays in detection and classification. Hence, it is essential to assess the robustness of the perception systems of automated vehicles (AVs) and explore strategies for making perception more reliable. We approach this problem by evaluating perception performance using predictive sensitivity quantification based on an ensemble of models, capturing model disagreement and inference variability across multiple models, under adverse driving scenarios in both simulated environments and real-world conditions. A notional architecture for assessing perception performance is proposed. A perception assessment criterion is developed based on an AV's stopping distance at a stop sign on varying road surfaces, such as dry and wet asphalt, and vehicle speed. Five state-of-the-art computer vision models are used, including YOLO (v8-v9), DEtection TRansformer (DETR50, DETR101), Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR)in our experiments. Diminished lighting conditions, e.g., resulting from the presence of fog and low sun altitude, have the greatest impact on the performance of the perception models. Additionally, adversarial road conditions such as occlusions of roadway objects increase perception sensitivity and model performance drops when faced with a combination of adversarial road conditions and inclement weather conditions. Also, it is demonstrated that the greater the distance to a roadway object, the greater the impact on perception performance, hence diminished perception robustness.",

Scaling laws: Prediction error decomposes into irreducible aleatoric uncertainty and reducible epistemic error; the epistemic component follows a power law in dataset size, continuing to shrink even when total loss plateaus. Limits of learning: The aleatoric floor is exactly measurable, and architectures differ markedly in how they approach it: ResNets exhibit clean power-law scaling while Vision Transformers stall in low-data regimes. Soft labels: Oracle posteriors contain learnable structure beyond class labels: training with exact posteriors outperforms hard labels and yields near-perfect calibration. Distribution shift: The oracle computes exact KL divergence of controlled perturbations, revealing that shift type matters more than shift magnitude: class imbalance barely affects accuracy at divergence values where input noise causes catastrophic degradation. Active learning: Exact epistemic uncertainty distinguishes genuinely informative samples from inherently ambiguous ones, improving sample efficiency. Our framework reveals that standard metrics hide ongoing learning, mask architectural differences, and cannot diagnose the nature of distribution shift.",

Effective information retrieval (IR) requires identifying metadata such as meeting number, date, location, participants, and start/end times, elements that are rarely standardized or easy to extract automatically. Existing named entity recognition (NER) models are ill-suited to this task, as they are not adapted to such domain-specific categories. In this paper, we propose a two-stage pipeline for metadata extraction from municipal minutes. First, a question answering (QA) model identifies the opening and closing text segments containing metadata. Transformer-based models (BERTimbau and XLM-RoBERTa with and without a CRF layer) are then applied for fine-grained entity extraction and enhanced through deslexicalization. To evaluate our proposed pipeline, we benchmark both open-weight (Phi) and closed-weight (Gemini) LLMs, assessing predictive performance, inference cost, and carbon footprint. Our results demonstrate strong in-domain performance, better than larger general-purpose LLMs. However, cross-municipality evaluation reveals reduced generalization reflecting the variability and linguistic complexity of municipal records. This work establishes the first benchmark for metadata extraction from municipal meeting minutes, providing a solid foundation for future research in this domain.",

        "abstract": "We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for next-utterance prediction in human dialogue. Despite recent advances in LLMs demonstrating their ability to engage in natural conversations with users, we show that even leading models surprisingly struggle to predict a human speaker's next utterance. Instead, humans can readily anticipate forthcoming utterances based on multimodal cues, such as gestures, gaze, and emotional tone, from the context. To systematically examine whether LLMs can reproduce this ability, we propose SayNext-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on anticipating context-conditioned responses from multimodal cues spanning a variety of real-world scenarios. To support this benchmark, we build SayNext-PC, a novel large-scale dataset containing dialogues with rich multimodal cues. Building on this, we further develop a dual-route prediction MLLM, SayNext-Chat, that incorporates cognitively inspired design to emulate predictive processing in conversation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs in terms of lexical overlap, semantic similarity, and emotion consistency. Our results prove the feasibility of next-utterance prediction with LLMs from multimodal cues and emphasize the (i) indispensable role of multimodal cues and (ii) actively predictive processing as the foundation of natural human interaction, which is missing in current MLLMs. We hope that this exploration offers a new research entry toward more human-like, context-sensitive AI interaction for human-centered AI.

Existing approaches mitigate memory pressure by offloading model state and KV tensors to host memory, but incur substantial latency due to limited PCIe bandwidth. We present Harvest, an opportunistic GPU cache management framework that exploits high-bandwidth peer-to-peer GPU interconnects to dynamically place model weights and KV cache in unused GPU memory. Harvest treats peer GPU memory as a transient cache tier, preserving correctness while reducing data movement overhead under dynamic memory availability. We demonstrate significant throughput speedup of more than 2 times by using Harvest to accelerate the retrieval of two widely-used inference components: expert layer weights and KV cache entries.",

Yet, existing steering methods are remarkably brittle, with seemingly non-steerable concepts becoming completely steerable based on subtle algorithmic choices in how concept-related features are extracted. In this work, we introduce an attention-guided steering framework that overcomes three core challenges associated with steering: (1) automatic selection of relevant token embeddings for extracting concept-related features; (2) accounting for heterogeneity of concept-related features across LLM activations; and (3) identification of layers most relevant for steering. Across a steering benchmark of 512 semantic concepts, our framework substantially improved steering over previous state-of-the-art (nearly doubling the number of successfully steered concepts) across model architectures and sizes (up to 70 billion parameter models). Furthermore, we use our framework to shed light on the distribution of concept-specific features across LLM layers. Overall, our framework opens further avenues for developing efficient, highly-scalable fine-tuning algorithms for industry-scale LLMs.",

In this work, we identify a distinct failure mode that previous study overlooked: Attention Distraction (AD). When the retrieved context is sufficient (highly relevant or including the correct answer), the retrieved text suppresses the visual attention globally, and the attention on image tokens shifts away from question-relevant regions. This leads to failures on questions the model could originally answer correctly without the retrieved text. To mitigate this issue, we propose MAD-RAG, a training-free intervention that decouples visual grounding from context integration through a dual-question formulation, combined with attention mixing to preserve image-conditioned evidence. Extensive experiments on OK-VQA, E-VQA, and InfoSeek demonstrate that MAD-RAG consistently outperforms existing baselines across different model families, yielding absolute gains of up to 4.76%, 9.20%, and 6.18% over the vanilla RAG baseline.

Existing adversarial approaches for exploiting this leakage are constrained by fundamental limitations: optimization-based methods are computationally expensive due to per-instance iterative search. At the same time, reasoning-based and heuristic techniques lack direct feedback from the target model's latent visual representations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReLAPSe, a policy-based adversarial framework that reformulates concept restoration as a reinforcement learning problem. ReLAPSe trains an agent using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), leveraging the diffusion model's noise prediction loss as a model-intrinsic and verifiable feedback signal. This closed-loop design directly aligns textual prompt manipulation with latent visual residuals, enabling the agent to learn transferable restoration strategies rather than optimizing isolated prompts. By pioneering the shift from per-instance optimization to global policy learning, ReLAPSe achieves efficient, near-real-time recovery of fine-grained identities and styles across multiple state-of-the-art unlearning methods, providing a scalable tool for rigorous red-teaming of unlearned diffusion models.

Motivated by these limitations, we study generative inference models guided by a unified reward function capturing core AP deployment objectives across diverse floorplans. We show that diffusion samplers consistently outperform alternative generative approaches. The diffusion process progressively improves sampling by smoothing and sharpening the reward landscape, rather than relying on iterative refinement, which is effective for non-convex and fragmented objectives. Finally, we introduce a large-scale real-world dataset for indoor AP deployment, requiring over $50k$ CPU hours to train general reward functions, and evaluate in- and out-of-distribution generalization and robustness. Our results suggest that diffusion-based generative inference with a unified reward function provides a scalable and domain-agnostic foundation for indoor AP deployment planning.",

Existing deployment-time adaptation methods, whether parametric fine-tuning or heuristic memory accumulation, lack the strategic agency needed to diagnose failures and produce durable improvements. Our position is that agentic evolution represents the inevitable future of LLM adaptation, elevating evolution itself from a fixed pipeline to an autonomous evolver agent. We instantiate this vision in a general framework, A-Evolve, which treats deployment-time improvement as a deliberate, goal-directed optimization process over persistent system state. We further propose the evolution-scaling hypothesis: the capacity for adaptation scales with the compute allocated to evolution, positioning agentic evolution as a scalable path toward sustained, open-ended adaptation in the real world.",

In this work, we propose a guided generation framework that introduces interpretable semantic axes, such as Demographics, Laboratory Parameters, and Behavioral Factors, to steer EC generation. These axes, derived using large language models, offer a middle ground between specificity and usability, enabling clinicians to guide generation without specifying exact entities. In addition, we present a reusable rubric-based evaluation framework that assesses generated criteria along clinically meaningful dimensions.

This self-referential setup enables surprisingly strong quality recovery after aggressive pruning.\nOur experiments reveal an unexpected finding: self-referential distillation alone, applied post-training under an identical objective and fixed calibration dataset, improves model quality by 39% relative to the original converged checkpoint. When combined with structured pruning, SparseKD achieves 15-65% parameter reduction with acceptable quality trade-offs. Kernel profiling shows that speedups arise entirely from reduced dense matrix multiplication in feed-forward layers while attention remains unchanged, making this approach complementary to attention optimizations.\nWe validate across two model families (0.6B and 3.8B parameters) with multi-seed experiments confirming high reproducibility.

This robustness, however, is not absolute. We identify a simple yet effective failure mode, termed context nesting, where harmful requests are embedded within structured benign contexts, effectively bypassing the stepwise reduction mechanism. Empirically, we show that this simple strategy is sufficient to bypass D-LLMs' safety blessing, achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across models and benchmarks.

While most research has been focused on English-based models, low-resource languages such as Brazilian Portuguese face significant challenges due to the lack of specialized datasets and models. Several studies create datasets by automatically translating existing ones to mitigate resource scarcity. This work addresses this gap by proposing a cross-native-translated evaluation of Transformer-based vision and language models for Brazilian Portuguese IC. We use a version of Flickr30K comprised of captions manually created by native Brazilian Portuguese speakers and compare it to a version with captions automatically translated from English to Portuguese. The experiments include a cross-context approach, where models trained on one dataset are tested on the other to assess the translation impact. Additionally, we incorporate attention maps for model inference interpretation and use the CLIP-Score metric to evaluate the image-description alignment. Our findings show that Swin-DistilBERTimbau consistently outperforms other models, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets. ViTucano, a Brazilian Portuguese pre-trained VLM, surpasses larger multilingual models (GPT-4o, LLaMa 3.2 Vision) in traditional text-based evaluation metrics, while GPT-4 models achieve the highest CLIP-Score, highlighting improved image-text alignment.

Unlike existing second-order approaches that rely on explicit or dense curvature representations, such as 3DGS-LM (HÃ¶llein et al., 2025) or 3DGS2 (Lan et al., 2025), our method approximates curvature using only the diagonal of the Hessian matrix, efficiently via Hutchinson's method. Our approach is fully matrix-free and has the same complexity as ADAM (Kingma, 2024), $O(n)$ in both computation and memory costs. To ensure stable optimization in the presence of strong nonlinearity in the 3DGS rasterization process, we introduce a parameter-wise trust-region technique based on the squared Hellinger distance, regularizing updates to Gaussian parameters. Under identical parameter initialization and without densification, 3DGS$^2$-TR is able to achieve better reconstruction quality on standard datasets, using 50% fewer training iterations compared to ADAM, while incurring less than 1GB of peak GPU memory overhead (17% more than ADAM and 85% less than 3DGS-LM), enabling scalability to very large scenes and potentially to distributed training settings.",

At short-to-moderate context lengths (1K--16K tokens), Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) dominate this cost, accounting for most of the total FLOPs. Existing FFN sparsification methods, designed for autoregressive decoding, fail to exploit the prefill stage's parallelism and often degrade accuracy. To address this, we introduce FastForward, a predictive sparsity framework that accelerates LLM prefill through block-wise, context-aware FFN sparsity. FastForward combines (1) a lightweight expert predictor to select high-importance neurons per block, (2) an error compensation network to correct sparsity-induced errors, and (3) a layer-wise sparsity scheduler to allocate compute based on token-mixing importance. Across LLaMA and Qwen models up to 8B parameters, FastForward delivers up to 1.45$\\times$ compute-bound speedup at 50% FFN sparsity with $<$ 6% accuracy loss compared to the dense baseline on LongBench, substantially reducing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) for efficient, long-context LLM inference on constrained hardware.",

In this work, we revisit the challenges associated with interpretability of feed-forward modules (FFNs) and propose MemoryLLM, which aims to decouple FFNs from self-attention and enables us to study the decoupled FFNs as context-free token-wise neural retrieval memory. In detail, we investigate how input tokens access memory locations within FFN parameters and the importance of FFN memory across different downstream tasks. MemoryLLM achieves context-free FFNs by training them in isolation from self-attention directly using the token embeddings. This approach allows FFNs to be pre-computed as token-wise lookups (ToLs), enabling on-demand transfer between VRAM and storage, additionally enhancing inference efficiency. We also introduce Flex-MemoryLLM, positioning it between a conventional transformer design and MemoryLLM. This architecture bridges the performance gap caused by training FFNs with context-free token-wise embeddings.",

We introduce ZEST (Zero-shot Embodied Skill Transfer), a streamlined motion-imitation framework that trains policies via reinforcement learning from diverse sources -- high-fidelity motion capture, noisy monocular video, and non-physics-constrained animation -- and deploys them to hardware zero-shot. ZEST generalizes across behaviors and platforms while avoiding contact labels, reference or observation windows, state estimators, and extensive reward shaping. Its training pipeline combines adaptive sampling, which focuses training on difficult motion segments, and an automatic curriculum using a model-based assistive wrench, together enabling dynamic, long-horizon maneuvers. We further provide a procedure for selecting joint-level gains from approximate analytical armature values for closed-chain actuators, along with a refined model of actuators. Trained entirely in simulation with moderate domain randomization, ZEST demonstrates remarkable generality. On Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoid, ZEST learns dynamic, multi-contact skills (e.g., army crawl, breakdancing) from motion capture. It transfers expressive dance and scene-interaction skills, such as box-climbing, directly from videos to Atlas and the Unitree G1. Furthermore, it extends across morphologies to the Spot quadruped, enabling acrobatics, such as a continuous backflip, through animation. Together, these results demonstrate robust zero-shot deployment across heterogeneous data sources and embodiments, establishing ZEST as a scalable interface between biological movements and their robotic counterparts.",

We address bias amplification during fine-tuning rather than costly pretraining, focusing on BERT models due to their widespread use in language understanding tasks. While Empirical Risk Minimization effectively optimizes downstream performance, it often amplifies social biases during fine-tuning. To counter this, we propose \\textit{RobustDebias}, a novel mechanism which adapts Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) to debias language models during fine-tuning.

Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often face challenges such as non-stationarity during training and limited generalization to unseen problem instances because they optimize representation learning and policy execution simultaneously. To address these issues, we introduce variational inference to the JSSP domain for the first time and derive a probabilistic objective based on the Evidence of Lower Bound (ELBO) with maximum entropy reinforcement learning. By mathematically decoupling representation learning from policy optimization, the VG2S framework enables the agent to learn robust structural representations of scheduling instances through a variational graph encoder. This approach significantly enhances training stability and robustness against hyperparameter variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior zero-shot generalization compared with state-of-the-art DRL baselines and traditional dispatching rules, particularly on large-scale and challenging benchmark instances such as DMU and SWV.",

        "abstract": "Coding agents have received significant adoption in software development recently. Unlike traditional LLM-based code completion tools, coding agents work with autonomy (e.g., invoking external tools) and leave visible traces in software repositories, such as authoring commits. Among their tasks, coding agents may autonomously generate software tests; however, the quality of these tests remains uncertain. In particular, excessive use of mocking can make tests harder to understand and maintain. This paper presents the first study to investigate the presence of mocks in agent-generated tests of real-world software systems. We analyzed over 1.2 million commits made in 2025 in 2,168 TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python repositories, including 48,563 commits by coding agents, 169,361 commits that modify tests, and 44,900 commits that add mocks to tests. Overall, we find that coding agents are more likely to modify tests and to add mocks to tests than non-coding agents. We detect that (1) 60% of the repositories with agent activity also contain agent test activity; (2) 23% of commits made by coding agents add/change test files, compared with 13% by non-agents; (3) 68% of the repositories with agent test activity also contain agent mock activity; (4) 36% of commits made by coding agents add mocks to tests, compared with 26% by non-agents; and (5) repositories created recently contain a higher proportion of test and mock commits made by agents. Finally, we conclude by discussing implications for developers and researchers. We call attention to the fact that tests with mocks may be potentially easier to generate automatically (but less effective at validating real interactions), and the need to include guidance on mocking practices in agent configuration files.",

Vision language models (VLMs) offer promise for autonomous laboratory safety monitoring, but their effectiveness in realistic settings is unclear due to the lack of visual evaluation data, as most safety incidents are documented primarily as unstructured text. To address this gap, we first introduce a structured data generation pipeline that converts textual laboratory scenarios into aligned triples of (image, scene graph, ground truth), using large language models as scene graph architects and image generation models as renderers. Our experiments on the synthetic dataset of 1,207 samples across 362 unique scenarios and seven open- and closed-source models show that VLMs perform effectively given textual scene graph, but degrade substantially in visual-only settings indicating difficulty in extracting structured object relationships directly from pixels. To overcome this, we propose a post-training context-engineering approach, scene-graph-guided alignment, to bridge perceptual gaps in VLMs by translating visual inputs into structured scene graphs better aligned with VLM reasoning, improving hazard detection performance in visual only settings.",

To this end, we introduce PolarMem, a training-free Polarized Latent Graph Memory designed to ground agent reasoning in verifiable evidence. PolarMem transforms fuzzy perceptual likelihoods into discrete logical constraints through non-parametric distributional partitioning. Furthermore, it employs a polarized graph topology with orthogonal inhibitory connections to explicitly store verified negation as a primary cognitive state. At inference time, we enforce a logic-dominant retrieval paradigm, suppressing hallucinatory patterns that violate negative constraints. Extensive evaluation across eight frozen Vision--Language Models and six benchmarks demonstrates that PolarMem functions as a robust cognitive system, establishing a foundation for verifiable multimodal agents.

However, these defenses often focus on analyzing explicit textual inputs or relevant visual scenes. In this work, we introduce Text-DJ, a novel jailbreak attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting the model's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability. Our methodology consists of three stages. First, we decompose a single harmful query into multiple and semantically related but more benign sub-queries. Second, we pick a set of distraction queries that are maximally irrelevant to the harmful query. Third, we present all decomposed sub-queries and distraction queries to the LVLM simultaneously as a grid of images, with the position of the sub-queries being middle within the grid. We demonstrate that this method successfully circumvents the safety alignment of state-of-the-art LVLMs. We argue this attack succeeds by (1) converting text-based prompts into images, bypassing standard text-based filters, and (2) inducing distractions, where the model's safety protocols fail to link the scattered sub-queries within a high number of irrelevant queries. Overall, our findings expose a critical vulnerability in LVLMs' OCR capabilities that are not robust to dispersed, multi-image adversarial inputs, highlighting the need for defenses for fragmented multimodal inputs.",

OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time.

Our method enables effective reinforcement of an energy-based objective while preserving diversity through composition conditioning, and it achieves performance competitive with score-based RL approaches.

However, within these multi-agent systems, the susceptibility of agents to collective cognitive biases remains an underexplored issue. A compelling example is the Mandela effect, a phenomenon where groups collectively misremember past events as a result of false details reinforced through social influence and internalized misinformation. This vulnerability limits our understanding of memory bias in multi-agent systems and raises ethical concerns about the potential spread of misinformation. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the Mandela effect in LLM-based multi-agent systems, focusing on its existence, causing factors, and mitigation strategies. We propose MANBENCH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agent behaviors across four common task types that are susceptible to the Mandela effect, using five interaction protocols that vary in agent roles and memory timescales. We evaluate agents powered by several LLMs on MANBENCH to quantify the Mandela effect and analyze how different factors affect it. Moreover, we propose strategies to mitigate this effect, including prompt-level defenses (e.g., cognitive anchoring and source scrutiny) and model-level alignment-based defense, achieving an average 74.40% reduction in the Mandela effect compared to the baseline. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more resilient and ethically aligned collaborative multi-agent systems.",

        "abstract": "Modern voice cloning (VC) can synthesize speech that closely matches a target speaker from only seconds of reference audio, enabling applications such as personalized speech interfaces and dubbing. In practical deployments, modern audio generation models inevitably encounter noisy reference audios, imperfect text prompts, and diverse downstream processing, which can significantly hurt robustness. Despite rapid progress in VC driven by autoregressive codec-token language models and diffusion-based models, robustness under realistic deployment shifts remains underexplored. This paper introduces RVCBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates Robustness in VC across the full generation pipeline, including input variation, generation challenges, output post-processing, and adversarial perturbations, covering 10 robustness tasks, 225 speakers, 14,370 utterances, and 11 representative modern VC models. Our evaluation uncovers substantial robustness gaps in VC: performance can deteriorate sharply under common input shifts and post-processing; long-context and cross-lingual scenarios further expose stability limitations; and both passive noise and proactive perturbation influence generation robustness. Collectively, these findings provide a unified picture of how current VC models fail in practice and introduce a standardized, open-source testbed to support the development of more robust and deployable VC models.

We address this problem by building non-fine-tunable foundation models: models that remain broadly usable in their released form while yielding limited adaptation gains under task-agnostic unauthorized fine-tuning. We propose Private Mask Pre-Training (PMP), a pre-training framework that concentrates representation learning into a sparse subnetwork identified early in training. The binary mask defining this subnetwork is kept private, and only the final dense weights are released. This forces unauthorized fine-tuning without access to the mask to update parameters misaligned with pretraining subspace, inducing an intrinsic mismatch between the fine-tuning objective and the pre-training geometry. We provide theoretical analysis showing that this mismatch destabilizes gradient-based adaptation and bounds fine-tuning gains. Empirical results on large language models demonstrating that PMP preserves base model performance while consistently degrading unauthorized fine-tuning across a wide range of downstream tasks, with the strength of non-fine-tunability controlled by the mask ratio.",

We study CODI, a continuous-thought teacher-student distillation model, on strictly sequential polynomial-iteration tasks. Using logit-lens decoding, linear probes, attention analysis, and activation patching, we localize intermediate-state representations and trace their routing to the final readout. On two- and three-hop tasks, CODI forms the full set of bridge states that become decodable across latent-thought positions, while the final input follows a separate near-direct route; predictions arise via late fusion at the end-of-thought boundary. For longer hop lengths, CODI does not reliably execute a full latent rollout, instead exhibiting a partial latent reasoning path that concentrates on late intermediates and fuses them with the last input at the answer readout position. Ablations show that this partial pathway can collapse under regime shifts, including harder optimization. Overall, we delineate when CODI-style latent-CoT yields faithful iterative computation versus compressed or shortcut strategies, and highlight challenges in designing robust latent-CoT objectives for sequential reasoning.",

We study reduced input frame rates, post-training quantization (INT8 and FP8), transfer to the WILDTRACK benchmark, and Transformer Engine mixed-precision fine-tuning. To better capture identity stability, we report Average Track Duration (AvgTrackDur), which measures identity persistence in seconds. Sparse4D remains stable under moderate FPS reductions, but below 2 FPS, identity association collapses even when detections are stable. Selective quantization of the backbone and neck offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off, while attention-related modules are consistently sensitive to low precision. On WILDTRACK, low-FPS pretraining yields large zero-shot gains over the base checkpoint, while small-scale fine-tuning provides limited additional benefit. Transformer Engine mixed precision reduces latency and improves camera scalability, but can destabilize identity propagation, motivating stability-aware validation.",

GRPO's critic-free architecture enables feasible on-device training, yet transitioning to a federated setting introduces systemic challenges: heterogeneous reward definitions, imbalanced multi-objective optimization, and high training costs. We propose FedMOA, a federated GRPO framework for multi-objective alignment under heterogeneous rewards. FedMOA stabilizes local training through an online adaptive weighting mechanism via hypergradient descent, which prioritizes primary reasoning as auxiliary objectives saturate. On the server side, it utilizes a task- and accuracy-aware aggregation strategy to prioritize high-quality updates. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that FedMOA consistently outperforms federated averaging, achieving accuracy gains of up to 2.2% while improving global performance, personalization, and multi-objective balance.",

These reveal that LLMs converge on consistent importance patterns, sharply different from pre-LLM baselines, and that LLMs cluster more by family than by size. Computationally, we identify that certain attention heads align well with empirical importance distributions, and that middle-to-late layers are strongly predictive of importance. Together, these results provide initial insights into what LLMs prioritize in summarization and how this priority is internally represented, opening a path toward interpreting and ultimately controlling information selection in these models.",

At the beginning of each episode, SIERL chooses a sub-goal from the \\textit{frontier} (the boundary of the agent's known state space), before the agent continues exploring toward the main task objective. The key contribution of our method is the sub-goal selection mechanism, which provides state-action pairs that are neither overly familiar nor completely novel. Thus, it assures that the frontier is expanded systematically and that the agent is capable of reaching any state within it. Inspired by search, sub-goals are prioritized from the frontier based on estimates of cost-to-come and cost-to-go, effectively steering exploration towards the most informative regions. In experiments on challenging sparse-reward environments, SIERL outperforms dominant baselines in both achieving the main task goal and generalizing to reach arbitrary states in the environment.",

Intriguingly, this mapping can be as simple as a shallow MLP transformation. To understand why LLMs can so readily process visual tokens, we need interpretability methods that reveal what is encoded in the visual token representations at every layer of LLM processing. In this work, we introduce LatentLens, a novel approach for mapping latent representations to descriptions in natural language. LatentLens works by encoding a large text corpus and storing contextualized token representations for each token in that corpus. Visual token representations are then compared to their contextualized textual representations, with the top-k nearest neighbor representations providing descriptions of the visual token. We evaluate this method on 10 different VLMs, showing that commonly used methods, such as LogitLens, substantially underestimate the interpretability of visual tokens. With LatentLens instead, the majority of visual tokens are interpretable across all studied models and all layers. Qualitatively, we show that the descriptions produced by LatentLens are semantically meaningful and provide more fine-grained interpretations for humans compared to individual tokens. More broadly, our findings contribute new evidence on the alignment between vision and language representations, opening up new directions for analyzing latent representations.",

First, a novel two-layer optimization architecture generates semantically coherent panoramas: a layout reasoning layer parses text into structured spatial relationships, while a self-optimization layer refines visual details via iterative MLLM feedback. Second, our panorama sliding mechanism initializes globally consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting point clouds by strategically sampling overlapping perspectives. By incorporating depth and semantic coherence losses during training, we greatly improve the quality and detail fidelity of rendered scenes.

Identifying intentions and generating desirable revisions are challenging due to their complex and diverse nature.

We conducted two workshops with community-based retired women dancers, employing interactive dance and LLM-powered video generation probes in co-design activities. Findings indicate that age-sensitive adaptations, such as low-barrier keyword input, motion-aligned visual effects, and participatory scaffolds, lowered technical barriers and fostered a sense of authorship. These features enabled retired women to empower their stage, transitioning from passive recipients of stage design to empowered co-creators of performance.

        "abstract": "VLMs have broad potential in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, yet strict data-sharing constraints render centralized training infeasible. FL mitigates this issue by enabling decentralized training, but practical deployments face challenges due to client heterogeneity in computational resources, application requirements, and model architectures. We argue that while replacing data with model parameters characterizes the present of FL, replacing parameters with preferences represents a more scalable and privacy-preserving future. Motivated by this perspective, we propose MoR, a federated alignment framework based on GRPO with Mixture-of-Rewards for heterogeneous VLMs. MoR initializes a visual foundation model as a KL-regularized reference, while each client locally trains a reward model from local preference annotations, capturing specific evaluation signals without exposing raw data. To reconcile heterogeneous rewards, we introduce a routing-based fusion mechanism that adaptively aggregates client reward signals. Finally, the server performs GRPO with this mixed reward to optimize the base VLM. Experiments on three public VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MoR consistently outperforms federated alignment baselines in generalization, robustness, and cross-client adaptability. Our approach provides a scalable solution for privacy-preserving alignment of heterogeneous VLMs under federated settings.",

To overcome these challenges, we propose the Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Dense Correlation Network (HSSDCT).

This creates systematic risks for low-resource languages and culturally marginalized communities, where data practices, model behavior, and accountability mechanisms often fail to align with local norms, rights, and expectations. Drawing on cross-cultural perspectives in human-centered computing and AI governance, this paper synthesizes existing evidence on multilingual model behavior, data asymmetries, and sociotechnical harm, and articulates a culturally grounded governance framework for MLLMs. We identify three interrelated governance challenges: cultural and linguistic inequities in training data and evaluation practices, misalignment between global deployment and locally situated norms, values, and power structures, and limited accountability mechanisms for addressing harms experienced by marginalized language communities. Rather than proposing new technical benchmarks, we contribute a conceptual agenda that reframes multilingual AI governance as a sociocultural and rights based problem. We outline design and policy implications for data stewardship, transparency, and participatory accountability, and argue that culturally grounded governance is essential for ensuring that multilingual language models do not reproduce existing global inequalities under the guise of scale and neutrality.",

While most existing efforts focus on scaling up language models or constructing higher-quality training data, limited attention has been paid to effectively integrating cross-modal knowledge into the language space. In vision-language models, for instance, aligning modalities using only high-level visual features often discards the rich semantic information present in mid- and low-level features, limiting the model's ability of cross-modality understanding. To address this issue, we propose SparseCut, a general cross-modal fusion architecture for MLLMs, introducing sparse shortcut connections between the cross-modal encoder and the LLM. These shortcut connections enable the efficient and hierarchical integration of visual features at multiple levels, facilitating richer semantic fusion without increasing computational overhead. We further introduce an efficient multi-grained feature fusion module, which performs the fusion of visual features before routing them through the shortcuts. This preserves the original language context and does not increase the overall input length, thereby avoiding an increase in computational complexity for the LLM. Experiments demonstrate that SparseCut significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs across various multimodal benchmarks with generality and scalability for different base LLMs.",

On the data side, we build a large-scale, high-quality instruction-tuning dataset by combining multimodal conversations rewritten from curated raw websites, and diverse synthetic examples covering everyday scenarios.

PROBE introduces Continuous Lookahead Pipelining, which proactively predicts, plans, and prefetches for upcoming layers while keeping all control overheads off the critical path. PROBE consists of: (1) a Gate-Initialized Lookahead Predictor that distills the target router to forecast next-layer expert activation with high fidelity; (2) a Hardware-Aware Balance Planning solver that jointly optimizes dynamic expert replication and token assignment under strict hiding-window constraints; and (3) a Phase-Locked Co-Scheduling policy that uses split-phase transmission to hide bandwidth-intensive expert transfers behind computation without contending with All-to-All collectives.

In this work, we present LVTG, a low-cost visuo-tactile gripper designed for stable, robust, and efficient physical interaction. Unlike existing visuo-tactile sensors, LVTG enables more effective and stable grasping of larger and heavier everyday objects, thanks to its enhanced tactile sensing area and greater opening angle. Its surface skin is made of highly wear-resistant material, significantly improving durability and extending operational lifespan. The integration of vision and tactile feedback allows LVTG to provide rich, high-fidelity sensory data, facilitating reliable perception during complex manipulation tasks. Furthermore, LVTG features a modular design that supports rapid maintenance and replacement. To effectively fuse vision and touch, We adopt a CLIP-inspired contrastive learning objective to align tactile embeddings with their corresponding visual observations, enabling a shared cross-modal representation space for visuo-tactile perception. This alignment improves the performance of an Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) policy in contact-rich manipulation, leading to more efficient data collection and more effective policy learning.

Such approaches, based on global graph partitioning and eigenvector-based formulations of affinity matrices, suffer from several fundamental drawbacks, they require pre-selecting the number of clusters, induce boundary oversmoothing due to spectral relaxation, and remain highly sensitive to noisy or multi-modal affinity distributions. Moreover, many prior works neglect the importance of local neighborhood structure, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing affinity propagation and preserving fine-grained contours. To address these limitations, we reformulate training-free segmentation as a stochastic flow equilibrium problem over diffusion-induced affinity graphs, where segmentation emerges from a stochastic propagation process that integrates global diffusion attention with local neighborhoods extracted from stable diffusion, yielding a sparse yet expressive affinity structure. Building on this formulation, we introduce a Markov propagation scheme that performs random-walk-based label diffusion with an adaptive pruning strategy that suppresses unreliable transitions while reinforcing confident affinity paths. Experiments across seven widely used semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, producing sharper boundaries, more coherent regions, and significantly more stable masks compared to prior spectral-clustering-based approaches.",

In this paper, we propose SAGE, a novel framework that dynamically adjusts the speculation tree structure based on real-time prediction uncertainty. Our key insight is that output entropy serves as a natural confidence indicator with strong temporal correlation across decoding steps. SAGE constructs deeper-narrower trees for high-confidence predictions to maximize speculation depth, and shallower-wider trees for uncertain predictions to diversify exploration. SAGE improves acceptance lengths and achieves faster acceleration compared to static tree baselines. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SAGE: without any loss in output quality, it delivers up to $3.36\\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and $3.18\\times$ for Qwen2.5-VL-72B.",

With the VL-PUB module, VLDet effectively exploits the visual-language knowledge from CLIP and adapts the backbone for object detection through feature pyramid. In addition, we introduce the SigRPN block, which incorporates a sigmoid-based anchor-text contrastive alignment loss to improve detection of novel categories. Through extensive experiments, our approach achieves 58.7 AP for novel classes on COCO2017 and 24.8 AP on LVIS, surpassing all state-of-the-art methods and achieving significant improvements of 27.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Furthermore, VLDet also demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on closed-set object detection.",

Though intensively discussed in the last few decades, existing constraint handling techniques predominantly rely on human experts' designs, which more or less fall short in utility towards general cases. Motivated by recent progress in Meta-Black-Box Optimization where automated algorithm design can be learned to boost optimization performance, in this paper, we propose learning effective, adaptive and generalizable constraint handling policy through reinforcement learning. Specifically, a tailored Markov Decision Process is first formulated, where given optimization dynamics features, a deep Q-network-based policy controls the constraint relaxation level along the underlying optimization process. Such adaptive constraint handling provides flexible tradeoff between objective-oriented exploitation and feasible-region-oriented exploration, and hence leads to promising optimization performance. We train our approach on CEC 2017 Constrained Optimization benchmark with limited evaluation budget condition (expensive cases) and compare the trained constraint handling policy to strong baselines such as recent winners in CEC/GECCO competitions. Extensive experimental results show that our approach performs competitively or even surpasses the compared baselines under either Leave-one-out cross-validation or ordinary train-test split validation. Further analysis and ablation studies reveal key insights in our designs.",

AIRE-Prune assigns every state a closed-form asymptotic impulse-response energy-based score, i.e., the total impulse-response energy it contributes over an infinite horizon (time), and normalizes these scores layer-wise to enable global cross-layer comparison and selection. This extends modal truncation from single systems to deep stacks and aligns pruning with asymptotic response energy rather than worst-case gain. Across diverse sequence benchmarks, AIRE-Prune reveals substantial redundancy in SISO and MIMO SSMs with average pruning of 60.8%, with average accuracy drop of 0.29% without retraining, while significantly lowering compute.

As experimental discovery is resource-intensive and time-consuming, efficient computational methodologies have become essential. The predominant paradigm formulates DDI prediction as a drug graph-based link prediction task. However, further progress is hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) lack of high-quality data: most studies rely on small-scale DDI datasets and single-modal drug representations; (2) lack of standardized evaluation: inconsistent scenarios, varied metrics, and diverse baselines. To address the above issues, we propose OpenDDI, a comprehensive benchmark for DDI prediction. Specifically, (1) from the data perspective, OpenDDI unifies 6 widely used DDI datasets and 2 existing forms of drug representation, while additionally contributing 3 new large-scale LLM-augmented datasets and a new multimodal drug representation covering 5 modalities. (2) From the evaluation perspective, OpenDDI unifies 20 SOTA model baselines across 3 downstream tasks, with standardized protocols for data quality, effectiveness, generalization, robustness, and efficiency. Based on OpenDDI, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and derive 10 valuable insights for DDI prediction while exposing current limitations to provide critical guidance for this rapidly evolving field.

A key aspect that impacts SAEAs' effectiveness is surrogate model selection, which in existing works is predominantly decided by human developer. Such human-made design choice introduces strong bias into SAEAs and may hurt their expected performance on out-of-scope tasks. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted ensemble framework, termed as SEEMOO, which is capable of scheduling different surrogate models within a single optimization process, hence boosting the overall optimization performance in a cooperative paradigm. Specifically, we focus on expensive multi-objective optimization problems, where multiple objective functions shape a compositional landscape and hence challenge surrogate selection. SEEMOO comprises following core designs: 1) A pre-collected model pool that maintains different surrogate models; 2) An attention-based state-extractor supports universal optimization state representation of problems with varied objective numbers; 3) a deep Q-network serves as dynamic surrogate selector: Given the optimization state, it selects desired surrogate model for current-step evaluation. SEEMOO is trained to maximize the overall optimization performance under a training problem distribution. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate SEEMOO's surrogate ensemble paradigm boosts the optimization performance of single-surrogate baselines.

To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{APEX} (Aerial Parallel Explorer), a novel hierarchical agent designed for efficient exploration and target acquisition in complex aerial settings. APEX is built upon a modular, three-part architecture: 1) Dynamic Spatio-Semantic Mapping Memory, which leverages the zero-shot capability of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to dynamically construct high-resolution 3D Attraction, Exploration, and Obstacle maps, serving as an interpretable memory mechanism. 2) Action Decision Module, trained with reinforcement learning, which translates this rich spatial understanding into a fine-grained and robust control policy. 3) Target Grounding Module, which employs an open-vocabulary detector to achieve definitive and generalizable target identification. All these components are integrated into a hierarchical, asynchronous, and parallel framework, effectively bypassing the VLM's inference latency and boosting the agent's proactivity in exploration. Extensive experiments show that APEX outperforms the previous state of the art by +4.2\\% SR and +2.8\\% SPL on challenging UAV-ON benchmarks, demonstrating its superior efficiency and the effectiveness of its hierarchical asynchronous design.

However, acquiring datasets that comprehensively cover diverse tasks and environments is extremely costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, human demonstration videos offer a rich and scalable source of diverse scenes and manipulation behaviors, yet their lack of explicit action supervision hinders direct utilization. Prior work leverages VQ-VAE based frameworks to learn latent actions from human videos in an unsupervised manner. Nevertheless, since the training objective primarily focuses on reconstructing visual appearances rather than capturing inter-frame dynamics, the learned representations tend to rely on spurious visual cues, leading to shortcut learning and entangled latent representations that hinder transferability. To address this, we propose ConLA, an unsupervised pretraining framework for learning robotic policies from human videos. ConLA introduces a contrastive disentanglement mechanism that leverages action category priors and temporal cues to isolate motion dynamics from visual content, effectively mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that ConLA achieves strong performance across diverse benchmarks. Notably, by pretraining solely on human videos, our method for the first time surpasses the performance obtained with real robot trajectory pretraining, highlighting its ability to extract pure and semantically consistent latent action representations for scalable robot learning.",

Motivated by these challenges and opportunities, we propose a Communication-based Diffusion World Model (NetWorld) to enable few-shot generalization across heterogeneous MARL tasks in wireless networks. To improve applicability to large-scale distributed networks, NetWorld adopts the Distributed Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm and is organized into a two-stage framework: (i) pre-training a classifier-guided conditional diffusion world model on multi-task offline datasets, and (ii) performing trajectory planning entirely within this world model to avoid additional online interaction. Cross-task heterogeneity is handled via shared latent processing for observations, two-hot discretization for task-specific actions and rewards, and an inverse dynamics model for action recovery. We further introduce a lightweight Mean Field (MF) communication mechanism to reduce non-stationarity and promote coordinated behaviors with low overhead.

To address this gap, we introduce ReasoningMath-Plus, a benchmark of 150 carefully curated problems explicitly designed to evaluate structural reasoning. Each problem emphasizes reasoning under interacting constraints, constructive solution formation, or non-trivial structural insight, and is annotated with a minimal reasoning skeleton to support fine-grained process-level evaluation. Alongside the dataset, we introduce HCRS (Hazard-aware Chain-based Rule Score), a deterministic step-level scoring function, and train a Process Reward Model (PRM) on the annotated reasoning traces. Empirically, while leading models attain relatively high final-answer accuracy (up to 5.8/10), HCRS-based holistic evaluation yields substantially lower scores (average 4.36/10, best 5.14/10), showing that answer-only metrics can overestimate reasoning robustness.",

Despite this underlying commonality, existing approaches typically adopt specialized model designs, which hinders cross-task generalization and system scalability.

Motivated by these observations, we propose UniMotion, a unified motion framework that captures shared structures across motion tasks while accommodating their individual requirements.

Specifically, during training, we optimize spectral utilization via the Frequency-Adaptive Non-uniform Compression (FANC) encoder, which preserves critical low-frequency harmonics while pruning high-frequency redundancies. Simultaneously, we introduce a Lightweight Image-based Spectro-Awareness (LISA) module to capture features from a visual perspective with minimal overhead. During inference, we propose a Training-free Lossless Boost (TLB) strategy that leverages the same dual-view priors to refine generation quality without any additional fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that DVPD achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 35% of the parameters and 40% of the inference MACs compared to SOTA lightweight model, PGUSE. These results highlight DVPD's superior ability to balance high-fidelity speech quality with extreme architectural efficiency.

        "abstract": "Vision-language tracking has gained increasing attention in many scenarios. This task simultaneously deals with visual and linguistic information to localize objects in videos. Despite its growing utility, the development of vision-language tracking methods remains in its early stage. Current vision-language trackers usually employ Transformer architectures for interactive integration of template, search, and text features. However, persistent challenges about low-semantic images including prevalent image blurriness, low resolution and so on, may compromise model performance through degraded cross-modal understanding. To solve this problem, language assistance is usually used to deal with the obstacles posed by low-semantic images. However, due to the existing gap between current textual and visual features, direct concatenation and fusion of these features may have limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce a pioneering Generative Language-AssisteD tracking model, GLAD, which utilizes diffusion models for the generative multi-modal fusion of text description and template image to bolster compatibility between language and image and enhance template image semantic information. Our approach demonstrates notable improvements over the existing fusion paradigms. Blurry and semantically ambiguous template images can be restored to improve multi-modal features in the generative fusion paradigm. Experiments show that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks and achieves an impressive inference speed.

While CoT helps LLMs and VLMs articulate intermediate steps, its text-only form often fails on vision-intensive problems where key intermediate states are inherently visual. We introduce modal-mixed CoT, which interleaves textual tokens with compact visual sketches represented as latent embeddings. To bridge the modality gap without eroding the original knowledge and capability of the VLM, we use the VLM itself as an encoder and train the language backbone to reconstruct its own intermediate vision embeddings, to guarantee the semantic alignment of the visual latent space. We further attach a diffusion-based latent decoder, invoked by a special control token and conditioned on hidden states from the VLM. In this way, the diffusion head carries fine-grained perceptual details while the VLM specifies high-level intent, which cleanly disentangles roles and reduces the optimization pressure of the VLM. Training proceeds in two stages: supervised fine-tuning on traces that interleave text and latents with a joint next-token and latent-reconstruction objective, followed by reinforcement learning that teaches when to switch modalities and how to compose long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across 11 diverse multimodal reasoning tasks, demonstrate that our method yields better performance than language-only and other CoT methods.

To address these challenges, we advocate for a paradigm shift from passive evaluation to Agentic Interactive Verification. We introduce VAGEN, a framework that employs a verifier agent equipped with interaction tools to autonomously plan verification strategies and proactively probe the environment for evidence of task completion. Leveraging the insight that GUI tasks are typically \"easy to verify but hard to solve\", VAGEN overcomes the bottlenecks of visual limitations. Experimental results on OSWorld-Verified and AndroidWorld benchmarks demonstrate that VAGEN significantly improves evaluation accuracy compared to LLM-as-a-Judge baselines and further enhances performance through test-time scaling strategies.",

In this work, we theoretically analyze an in-context linear regression model with multi-head linear self-attention, and compare the training dynamics of two gradient based optimizers, namely gradient descent (GD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), the latter exhibiting superior generalization properties but is prohibitively expensive for training even medium-sized LLMs. We show, for the first time, that SAM induces a lower simplicity bias (SB)-the tendency of an optimizer to preferentially learn simpler features earlier in training-and identify this reduction as a key factor underlying its improved generalization performance. Motivated by this insight, we demonstrate that altering the training data distribution by upsampling or augmenting examples learned later in training similarly reduces SB and leads to improved generalization. Our extensive experiments show that our strategy improves the performance of multiple LLMs-including Phi2-2.7B , Llama3.2-1B, Gemma3-1B-PT, and Qwen3-0.6B-Base-achieving relative accuracy gains up to 18% when fine-tuned with AdamW and Muon on mathematical reasoning tasks.",

Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution to selectively remove such information without full retraining. However, existing methods are designed for dense models and overlook model sparsification-an essential technique for efficient LLM deployment. We find that unlearning effectiveness degrades substantially on sparse models. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that this degradation occurs because existing unlearning methods require updating all parameters, yet sparsification prunes substantial weights to zero, fundamentally limiting the model's forgetting capacity. To address this challenge, we propose Sparsity-Aware Unlearning (SAU), which decouples unlearning from sparsification objectives through gradient masking that redirects updates to surviving weights, combined with importance-aware redistribution to compensate for pruned parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAU significantly outperforms existing methods on sparse LLMs, achieving effective forgetting while preserving model utility.",

The challenges lie in sampling the distribution of high-quality images and adjusting the outputs on the basis of the degradation. This paper presents a novel approach, Bridging Degradation discrimination and Generation (BDG), which aims to address these challenges concurrently. First, we propose the Multi-Angle and multi-Scale Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (MAS-GLCM) and demonstrate its effectiveness in performing fine-grained discrimination of degradation types and levels. Subsequently, we divide the diffusion training process into three distinct stages: generation, bridging, and restoration. The objective is to preserve the diffusion model's capability of restoring rich textures while simultaneously integrating the discriminative information from the MAS-GLCM into the restoration process. This enhances its proficiency in addressing multi-task and multi-degraded scenarios. Without changing the architecture, BDG achieves significant performance gains in all-in-one restoration and real-world super-resolution tasks, primarily evidenced by substantial improvements in fidelity without compromising perceptual quality.

Our MAUGen involves two key modules: (1) a Multi-modal Representation Learning (MRL) module that captures the relationships among the paired textual description, facial identity, expression image, and AU activations within a unified latent space; and (2) a Diffusion-based Image label Generator (DIG) that decodes the joint representation into aligned facial image-label pairs across diverse identities. Under this framework, we introduce Multi-Identity Facial Action (MIFA), a large-scale multimodal synthetic dataset featuring comprehensive AU annotations and identity variations.

Our approach combines three key mechanisms: (1) Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (aSGLD) for reward critics, promoting ensemble diversity and escape from poor optima; (2) distributional cost estimation via Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN) with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization for tail-risk mitigation; and (3) a reactive Lagrangian relaxation scheme that adapts constraint enforcement based on the empirical CVaR of episodic costs.

Patching techniques, commonly used and effective in time series modeling, help capture temporal dependencies by dividing the data into patches. However, existing patch-based methods fail to dynamically select patches and typically use all patches during the prediction process. In real-world time series, there are often low-quality issues during data collection, such as missing values, distribution shifts, anomalies and white noise, which may cause some patches to contain low-quality information, negatively impacting the prediction results. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust time series forecasting framework called SEER. Firstly, we propose an Augmented Embedding Module, which improves patch-wise representations using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and obtains series-wise token representations through a channel-adaptive perception mechanism. Secondly, we introduce a Learnable Patch Replacement Module, which enhances forecasting robustness and model accuracy through a two-stage process: 1) a dynamic filtering mechanism eliminates negative patch-wise tokens; 2) a replaced attention module substitutes the identified low-quality patches with global series-wise token, further refining their representations through a causal attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the SOTA performance of SEER.",

Although many models incorporate time through encodings or architectural design, they often compute attention over entangled node and edge representations, failing to reflect their distinct temporal behaviors. Node embeddings evolve slowly as they aggregate long-term structural context, while edge features reflect transient, timestamped interactions (e.g. messages, trades, or transactions). This mismatch results in semantic attention blurring, where attention weights cannot distinguish between slowly drifting node states and rapidly changing, information-rich edge interactions. As a result, models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and provide limited transparency into how temporal relevance is computed. This paper introduces KEAT (Kernelized Edge Attention for Temporal Graphs), a novel attention formulation that modulates edge features using a family of continuous-time kernels, including Laplacian, RBF, and learnable MLP variant. KEAT preserves the distinct roles of nodes and edges, and integrates seamlessly with both Transformer-style (e.g., DyGFormer) and message-passing (e.g., TGN) architectures. It achieves up to 18% MRR improvement over the recent DyGFormer and 7% over TGN on link prediction tasks, enabling more accurate, interpretable and temporally aware message passing in TGNNs.",

These algorithms work with very limited feedback in the form of pairwise preferences and fine-tune models to align with these preferences without explicitly learning a reward model. While the form of feedback used by these algorithms makes the data collection process easy and relatively more accurate, its ambiguity in terms of the quality of responses could have negative implications. For example, it is not clear if a decrease (increase) in the likelihood of preferred (dispreferred) responses during the execution of these algorithms could be interpreted as a positive or negative phenomenon. In this paper, we study how to design algorithms that can leverage additional information in the form of rating gap, which informs the learner how much the chosen response is better than the rejected one. We present new algorithms that can achieve faster statistical rates than DPO in presence of accurate rating gap information. Moreover, we theoretically prove and empirically show that the performance of our algorithms is robust to inaccuracy in rating gaps. Finally, we demonstrate the solid performance of our methods in comparison to a number of DPO-style algorithms across a wide range of LLMs and evaluation benchmarks.",

However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain largely designed for human-recorded videos or single-speaker settings. As a result, potential errors that occur in generated multi-talker dialogue videos, such as identity drift, unnatural turn transitions, and audio-visual misalignment, cannot be effectively captured and analyzed. To address this issue, we introduce MTAVG-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating audio-visual multi-speaker dialogue generation. MTAVG-Bench is built via a semi-automatic pipeline, where 1.8k videos are generated using multiple popular models with carefully designed prompts, yielding 2.4k manually annotated QA pairs. The benchmark evaluates multi-speaker dialogue generation at four levels: audio-visual signal fidelity, temporal attribute consistency, social interaction, and cinematic expression. We benchmark 12 proprietary and open-source omni-models on MTAVG-Bench, with Gemini 3 Pro achieving the strongest overall performance, while leading open-source models remain competitive in signal fidelity and consistency. Overall, MTAVG-Bench enables fine-grained failure analysis for rigorous model comparison and targeted video generation refinement.",

However, as probabilistic models, they still struggle to generate syntactically valid outputs reliably. A natural and promising direction to address this issue is to adapt constrained decoding techniques to enforce grammatical correctness during generation. However, applying these techniques faces two primary obstacles. On the one hand, the non-autoregressive nature of dLLMs renders most existing constrained decoding approaches inapplicable. On the other hand, current approaches specifically designed for dLLMs may allow intermediate outputs that are impossible to complete into valid sentences, which significantly limits their reliability in practice.\nTo address these challenges, we present LAVE, a constrained decoding approach specifically designed for dLLMs. Our approach leverages a key property of dLLMs, namely their ability to predict token distributions for all positions in parallel during each forward pass. Whenever a new token is proposed by model, LAVE performs lookahead using these distributions to efficiently and reliably verify the validity of the proposed token. This design ensures reliable constraints by reliably preserving the potential for intermediate outputs to be extended into valid sentences. Extensive experiments across four widely used dLLMs and three representative benchmarks demonstrate that LAVE consistently outperforms existing baselines and achieves substantial improvements in syntactic correctness, while incurring negligible runtime overhead.",

We formalize this tension through a total variation (TV) lens: once the reference conditional distribution is fixed, any nontrivial reduction in unsafe generations necessarily incurs TV deviation from the reference, yielding a principled Safety-Prompt Alignment Trade-off (SPAT). Guided by this view, we propose an inference-only prompt projection framework that selectively intervenes on high-risk prompts via a surrogate objective with verification, mapping them into a tolerance-controlled safe set while leaving benign prompts effectively unchanged, without retraining or fine-tuning the generator. Across four datasets and three diffusion backbones, our approach achieves 16.7-60.0% relative reductions in inappropriate percentage (IP) versus strong model-level alignment baselines, while preserving benign prompt-image alignment on COCO near the unaligned reference.",

Recently, 3DGS-based stylization methods have drawn considerable attention, primarily due to their markedly enhanced training and rendering speeds. However, a vital challenge for 3D style transfer is to strike a balance between the content and the patterns and colors of the style. Although the existing methods strive to achieve relatively balanced outcomes, the fixed-output paradigm struggles to adapt to the diverse content-style balance requirements from different users. In this work, we introduce a creative intensity-tunable 3D style transfer paradigm, dubbed \\textbf{Tune-Your-Style}, which allows users to flexibly adjust the style intensity injected into the scene to match their desired content-style balance, thus enhancing the customizability of 3D style transfer. To achieve this goal, we first introduce Gaussian neurons to explicitly model the style intensity and parameterize a learnable style tuner to achieve intensity-tunable style injection. To facilitate the learning of tunable stylization, we further propose the tunable stylization guidance, which obtains multi-view consistent stylized views from diffusion models through cross-view style alignment, and then employs a two-stage optimization strategy to provide stable and efficient guidance by modulating the balance between full-style guidance from the stylized views and zero-style guidance from the initial rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only delivers visually appealing results, but also exhibits flexible customizability for 3D style transfer.

We show that logit-arithmetic jailbreaking methods are a special case of this framework under cross-entropy loss, and derive a broader family of aggregation rules corresponding to other proper losses.

We further provide theoretical justification that in-context inference can subsume trained classifiers and can emulate gradient-based classifier training within a single forward pass.

Applying this metric to a three-layer MLP backbone reveals depth-specific specialization in modeling temporal dynamics in the input sequence.

MoDEx achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world benchmarks, ranking first in 78 percent of cases, while using significantly fewer parameters and computational resources.

Using representational similarity analysis, we compare behavioral geometries to layerwise hidden-state similarity and benchmark against FastText, BERT, and cross-model consensus. We find that forced-choice behavior aligns substantially more with hidden-state geometry than free association. In a held-out-words regression, behavioral similarity (especially forced choice) predicts unseen hidden-state similarities beyond lexical baselines and cross-model consensus, indicating that behavior-only measurements retain recoverable information about internal semantic geometry.

Load disturbances and model errors are compensated for by a feedback controller on the lower level. In that regard, we briefly examine the robustness of both model-free and model-based learning approaches, and it is shown that the model-free approach greatly suffers from the inclusion of unmodeled dynamics.

This is because occlusion is a high-level concept, it does not refer to a concrete category of object. Thus, constructing a real-world face dataset covering all categories of occlusion object is almost impossible and accurate mask annotation is labor-intensive. To deal with the problems, we present S$^3$POT, a contrast-driven framework synergizing face generation with self-supervised spatial prompting, to achieve occlusion segmentation. The framework is inspired by the insights: 1) Modern face generators' ability to realistically reconstruct occluded regions, creating an image that preserve facial geometry while eliminating occlusion, and 2) Foundation segmentation models' (e.g., SAM) capacity to extract precise mask when provided with appropriate prompts. In particular, S$^3$POT consists of three modules: Reference Generation (RF), Feature enhancement (FE), and Prompt Selection (PS). First, a reference image is produced by RF using structural guidance from parsed mask. Second, FE performs contrast of tokens between raw and reference images to obtain an initial prompt, then modifies image features with the prompt by cross-attention. Third, based on the enhanced features, PS constructs a set of positive and negative prompts and screens them with a self-attention network for a mask decoder. The network is learned under the guidance of three novel and complementary objective functions without occlusion ground truth mask involved. Extensive experiments on a dedicatedly collected dataset demonstrate S$^3$POT's superior performance and the effectiveness of each module.",

While limiting exploration to a feasible zone has become widely accepted as a way to ensure safety, key questions remain unresolved: what is the maximum feasible zone achievable through exploration, and how can it be identified? This paper, for the first time, answers these questions by revealing that the goal of safe exploration is to find the equilibrium between the feasible zone and the environment model. This conclusion is based on the understanding that these two components are interdependent: a larger feasible zone leads to a more accurate environment model, and a more accurate model, in turn, enables exploring a larger zone. We propose the first equilibrium-oriented safe exploration framework called safe equilibrium exploration (SEE), which alternates between finding the maximum feasible zone and the least uncertain model. Using a graph formulation of the uncertain model, we prove that the uncertain model obtained by SEE is monotonically refined, the feasible zones monotonically expand, and both converge to the equilibrium of safe exploration. Experiments on classic control tasks show that our algorithm successfully expands the feasible zones with zero constraint violation, and achieves the equilibrium of safe exploration within a few iterations.",

        "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive general capabilities, their direct application in the legal domain is often hindered by a lack of precise domain knowledge and complexity of performing rigorous multi-step judicial reasoning. To address this gap, we present LegalOne, a family of foundational models specifically tailored for the Chinese legal domain. LegalOne is developed through a comprehensive three-phase pipeline designed to master legal reasoning. First, during mid-training phase, we propose Plasticity-Adjusted Sampling (PAS) to address the challenge of domain adaptation. This perplexity-based scheduler strikes a balance between the acquisition of new knowledge and the retention of original capabilities, effectively establishing a robust legal foundation. Second, during supervised fine-tuning, we employ Legal Agentic CoT Distillation (LEAD) to distill explicit reasoning from raw legal texts. Unlike naive distillation, LEAD utilizes an agentic workflow to convert complex judicial processes into structured reasoning trajectories, thereby enforcing factual grounding and logical rigor. Finally, we implement a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategy. Through a progressive reinforcement process spanning memorization, understanding, and reasoning, LegalOne evolves from simple pattern matching to autonomous and reliable legal reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that LegalOne achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of legal tasks, surpassing general-purpose LLMs with vastly larger parameter counts through enhanced knowledge density and efficiency. We publicly release the LegalOne weights and the LegalKit evaluation framework to advance the field of Legal AI, paving the way for deploying trustworthy and interpretable foundation models in high-stakes judicial applications.",

        "abstract": "While existing multivariate time series forecasting models have advanced significantly in modeling periodicity, they largely neglect the periodic heterogeneity common in real-world data, where variates exhibit distinct and dynamically changing periods. To effectively capture this periodic heterogeneity, we propose PHAT (Period Heterogeneity-Aware Transformer). Specifically, PHAT arranges multivariate inputs into a three-dimensional \"periodic bucket\" tensor, where the dimensions correspond to variate group characteristics with similar periodicity, time steps aligned by phase, and offsets within the period. By restricting interactions within buckets and masking cross-bucket connections, PHAT effectively avoids interference from inconsistent periods. We also propose a positive-negative attention mechanism, which captures periodic dependencies from two perspectives: periodic alignment and periodic deviation. Additionally, the periodic alignment attention scores are decomposed into positive and negative components, with a modulation term encoding periodic priors. This modulation constrains the attention mechanism to more faithfully reflect the underlying periodic trends. A mathematical explanation is provided to support this property. We evaluate PHAT comprehensively on 14 real-world datasets against 18 baselines, and the results show that it significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving highly competitive forecasting performance.

However, this paradigm suffers from two critical challenges: Structural Degeneration, where hierarchical and semantic representations are entangled, and Optimization Instability, which arises from oscillatory dynamics of minimax adversarial training. To tackle these issues, we propose DisRFM, a geometry-aware GDA framework that unifies Riemannian embedding and flow-based transport. First, to overcome structural degeneration, we embed graphs into a Riemannian manifold. By adopting polar coordinates, we explicitly disentangle structure (radius) from semantics (angle). Then, we enforce topology preservation through radial Wasserstein alignment and semantic discrimination via angular clustering, thereby preventing feature entanglement and collapse. Second, we address the instability of adversarial alignment by using Riemannian flow matching. This method learns a smooth vector field to guide source features toward the target along geodesic paths, guaranteeing stable convergence. The geometric constraints further guide the flow to maintain the disentangled structure during transport. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic stability of the flow matching and derive a tighter bound for the target risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisRFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

This study proposes an explainable prognostic framework for UF membrane remaining useful life (RUL) estimation using fuzzy similarity reasoning. A physics-informed Health Index, derived from transmembrane pressure, flux, and resistance, captures degradation dynamics, which are then fuzzified via Gaussian membership functions. Using a similarity measure, the model identifies historical degradation trajectories resembling the current state and formulates RUL predictions as Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules. Each rule corresponds to a historical exemplar and contributes to a transparent, similarity-weighted RUL estimate. Tested on 12,528 operational cycles from an industrial-scale UF system, the framework achieved a mean absolute error of 4.50 cycles, while generating interpretable rule bases consistent with expert understanding.",

This study investigates instruction-tuned SLMs for context-summarized multi-turn customer-service QA, using a history summarization strategy to preserve essential conversational state. We also introduce a conversation stage-based qualitative analysis to evaluate model behavior across different phases of customer-service interactions. Nine instruction-tuned low-parameterized SLMs are evaluated against three commercial LLMs using lexical and semantic similarity metrics alongside qualitative assessments, including human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Results show notable variation across SLMs, with some models demonstrating near-LLM performance, while others struggle to maintain dialogue continuity and contextual alignment.

Existing streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting compression methods typically leverage a latent representation to drive the neural network for predicting Gaussian residuals between frames. Their core latent representations can be categorized into structured grid-based and unstructured point-based paradigms. However, the former incurs significant parameter redundancy by inevitably modeling unoccupied space, while the latter suffers from limited compactness as it fails to exploit local correlations. To relieve these limitations, we propose HPC, a novel streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting compression framework. It employs a hierarchical point-based latent representation that operates on a per-Gaussian basis to avoid parameter redundancy in unoccupied space. Guided by a tailored aggregation scheme, these latent points achieve high compactness with low spatial redundancy. To improve compression efficiency, we further undertake the first investigation to compress neural networks for streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting through mining and exploiting the inter-frame correlation of parameters. Combined with latent compression, this forms a fully end-to-end compression framework. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HPC substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It achieves a storage reduction of 67% against its baseline while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity.",

To this aim, Janus (i) decomposes the overall behavior into specialized modules, related to scope detection, intent recognition, memory, inner speech, query generation, and outer speech, and (ii) exposes explicit policies for information sufficiency, execution readiness, and tool grounding. A dedicated memory agent maintains a bounded recent-history buffer, a compact core memory, and an archival store with semantic retrieval, coupled through controlled consolidation and revision policies. Models inspired by the notion of inner speech in cognitive theories provide a control-oriented internal textual flow that validates parameter completeness and triggers clarification before grounding, while a faithfulness constraint ties robot-to-human claims to an evidence bundle combining working context and retrieved tool outputs. We evaluate JANUS through module-level unit tests in a dietary assistance domain grounded on a knowledge graph, reporting high agreement with curated references and practical latency profiles. These results support factored reasoning as a promising path to scalable, auditable, and evidence-grounded robot assistance over extended interaction horizons.",

Despite remarkable progress across domains ranging from pattern recognition to intelligent decision-making in recent decades, exemplified by breakthroughs in board games, card games, and electronic sports games, there remains a pressing need for more challenging benchmarks to drive further research. To this end, this paper proposes OpenGuanDan, a novel benchmark that enables both efficient simulation of GuanDan (a popular four-player, multi-round Chinese card game) and comprehensive evaluation of both learning-based and rule-based GuanDan AI agents. OpenGuanDan poses a suite of nontrivial challenges, including imperfect information, large-scale information set and action spaces, a mixed learning objective involving cooperation and competition, long-horizon decision-making, variable action spaces, and dynamic team composition. These characteristics make it a demanding testbed for existing intelligent decision-making methods. Moreover, the independent API for each player allows human-AI interactions and supports integration with large language models. Empirically, we conduct two types of evaluations: (1) pairwise competitions among all GuanDan AI agents, and (2) human-AI matchups. Experimental results demonstrate that while current learning-based agents substantially outperform rule-based counterparts, they still fall short of achieving superhuman performance, underscoring the need for continued research in multi-agent intelligent decision-making domain.

The MoE policy employs a gated set of specialist experts to decompose latent terrain and command modeling, achieving superior deployment robustness and generalization via proprioception alone. RoboGauge further provides multi-dimensional proprioception-based metrics via sim-to-sim tests over terrains, difficulty levels, and domain randomizations, enabling reliable MoE policy selection without extensive physical trials. Experiments on a Unitree Go2 demonstrate robust locomotion on unseen challenging terrains, including snow, sand, stairs, slopes, and 30 cm obstacles.

Improving inference efficiency is therefore essential for practical robotic applications. Existing acceleration methods often rely on heuristic or static strategies--such as rule-based token caching or pruning--that are decoupled from task objectives and fail to adapt to dynamic scene changes. In this work, we reformulate inference acceleration as a learnable policy optimization problem and propose a novel framework that integrates a dynamic, task-aware decision-making process directly into the VLA model. At its core are two lightweight, cooperative modules: a Cached Token Selector, which determines which tokens should be reused, and a Cache Ratio Predictor, which controls how many tokens to reuse. Training these modules is non-trivial due to their discrete decisions. We address this by adopting a differentiable relaxation that allows gradient-based end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO and SIMPLER benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations, show that our method achieves a 1.76x wall-clock inference speedup while simultaneously improving the average success rate by 1.9 percentage points (from 75.0% to 76.9%) on LIBERO and by 5.0 percentage points on real-world tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

        "abstract": "The generation of Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code is a crucial yet labor-intensive step in digital hardware design, traditionally requiring engineers to manually translate complex specifications into thousands of lines of synthesizable Hardware Description Language (HDL) code. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating this process, existing approaches-including fine-tuned domain-specific models and advanced agent-based systems-struggle to scale to industrial IP-level design tasks. We identify three key challenges: (1) handling long, highly detailed documents, where critical interface constraints become buried in unrelated submodule descriptions; (2) generating long RTL code, where both syntactic and semantic correctness degrade sharply with increasing output length; and (3) navigating the complex debugging cycles required for functional verification through simulation and waveform analysis. To overcome these challenges, we propose LocalV, a multi-agent framework that leverages information locality in modular hardware design. LocalV decomposes the long-document to long-code generation problem into a set of short-document, short-code tasks, enabling scalable generation and debugging. Specifically, LocalV integrates hierarchical document partitioning, task planning, localized code generation, interface-consistent merging, and AST-guided locality-aware debugging. Experiments on RealBench, an IP-level Verilog generation benchmark, demonstrate that LocalV substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and agents, achieving a pass rate of 45.0% compared to 21.6%.",

To address this, we present USS-Nav, a lightweight framework that incrementally constructs a Unified Spatio-Semantic scene graph and enables efficient Large Language Model (LLM)-augmented Zero-Shot Object Navigation in unknown environments. Specifically, we introduce an incremental Spatial Connectivity Graph generation method utilizing polyhedral expansion to capture global geometric topology, which is dynamically partitioned into semantic regions via graph clustering. Concurrently, open-vocabulary object semantics are instantiated and anchored to this topology to form a hierarchical environmental representation. Leveraging this hierarchical structure, we present a coarse-to-fine exploration strategy: LLM grounded in the scene graph's semantics to determine global target regions, while a local planner optimizes frontier coverage based on information gain. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and real-time update frequency (15 Hz) on a resource-constrained platform. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our framework, showing substantial improvements in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).

First, we design a physics-informed mask strategy to guide the diffusion generation process based on a local receptive field, effectively eliminating noise interference. Second, we impose a physics-informed constraint on the diffusion generation results following the kriging principle of geomagnetic maps, ensuring strict adherence to the laws of physics.

Prevalent approaches address this by identifying a small coreset of items to approximate full-benchmark performance. However, existing methods must estimate a reliable item profile from response patterns across many source models, which becomes statistically unstable when the source pool is small. This dependency is particularly limiting for newly released benchmarks with minimal historical evaluation data. We argue that discrete correctness labels are a lossy view of the model's decision process and fail to capture information encoded in hidden states. To address this, we introduce REPCORE, which aligns heterogeneous hidden states into a unified latent space to construct representative coresets. Using these subsets for performance extrapolation, REPCORE achieves precise estimation accuracy with as few as ten source models. Experiments on five benchmarks and over 200 models show consistent gains over output-based baselines in ranking correlation and estimation accuracy. Spectral analysis further indicates that the aligned representations contain separable components reflecting broad response tendencies and task-specific reasoning patterns.",

We present an IntelliJ IDEA plugin prototype that uses code-level software metrics to identify potentially security-critical methods and large language models (LLMs) to generate prevention-oriented explanations. Our initial evaluation on the Spring-PetClinic application shows that the selected metrics identify most known security-critical methods, while an LLM provides actionable, prevention-focused insights. Although these metrics capture structural properties rather than semantic aspects of security, this work lays the foundation for code-level security-aware metrics and enhanced explanations.",

In recent years, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for the automatic generation of program specifications has emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing verification efficiency. However, existing research has been predominantly confined to generating specifications based on basic syntactic constructs, falling short of meeting the demands for high-level abstraction in complex program verification. Consequently, we propose incorporating logical constructs into existing LLM-based specification generation framework. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of systematic investigation into whether LLMs can effectively generate such complex constructs. To this end, we conduct an empirical study aimed at exploring the impact of various types of syntactic constructs on specification generation framework. Specifically, we define four syntactic configurations with varying levels of abstraction and perform extensive evaluations on mainstream program verification datasets, employing a diverse set of representative LLMs. Experimental results first confirm that LLMs are capable of generating valid logical constructs. Further analysis reveals that the synergistic use of logical constructs and basic syntactic constructs leads to improvements in both verification capability and robustness, without significantly increasing verification overhead. Additionally, we uncover the distinct advantages of two refinement paradigms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic work exploring the feasibility of utilizing LLMs for generating high-level logical constructs, providing an empirical basis and guidance for the future construction of automated program verification framework with enhanced abstraction capabilities.",

Most existing approaches treat continual learning as avoiding interference with past updates, rather than considering what properties make the current task-specific update naturally preserve previously acquired knowledge. From a knowledge-decomposition perspective, we observe that low-rank adaptations exhibit highly imbalanced singular value spectra: a few dominant components absorb most of the adaptation energy, thereby (i) more likely to disrupt previously acquired knowledge and (ii) making the update more vulnerable to interference from subsequent tasks. To enable explicit balance among components, we decouple the magnitude of the task update from its directional structure and formulate it as a constrained optimization problem on a restricted Stiefel manifold. We address this problem using a projected first-order method compatible with standard deep-learning optimizers used in vision-language models. Our method mitigates both backward and forward forgetting, consistently outperforming continual learning baselines. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/haodotgu/EBLoRA.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce prompt multiplicity, a framework for quantifying consistency in LLM evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant multiplicity (over 50% inconsistency in benchmarks like Med-HALT), suggesting that hallucination-related harms have been severely misunderstood. Furthermore, we study the role of consistency in hallucination detection and mitigation. We find that: (a) detection techniques detect consistency, not correctness, and (b) mitigation techniques like RAG, while beneficial, can introduce additional inconsistencies. By integrating prompt multiplicity into hallucination evaluation, we provide an improved framework of potential harms and uncover critical limitations in current detection and mitigation strategies.",

On commonly used evaluation metrics, ACE-Step v1.5 achieves quality beyond most commercial music models while remaining extremely fast -- under 2 seconds per full song on an A100 and under 10 seconds on an RTX 3090. The model runs locally with less than 4GB of VRAM, and supports lightweight personalization: users can train a LoRA from just a few songs to capture their own style. At its core lies a novel hybrid architecture where the Language Model (LM) functions as an omni-capable planner: it transforms simple user queries into comprehensive song blueprints -- scaling from short loops to 10-minute compositions -- while synthesizing metadata, lyrics, and captions via Chain-of-Thought to guide the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Uniquely, this alignment is achieved through intrinsic reinforcement learning relying solely on the model's internal mechanisms, thereby eliminating the biases inherent in external reward models or human preferences. Beyond standard synthesis, ACE-Step v1.5 unifies precise stylistic control with versatile editing capabilities -- such as cover generation, repainting, and vocal-to-BGM conversion -- while maintaining strict adherence to prompts across 50+ languages. This paves the way for powerful tools that seamlessly integrate into the creative workflows of music artists, producers, and content creators.

We systematically evaluate LongCodeOCR against the state-of-the-art LongCodeZip across four benchmarks spanning code summarization, code question answering, and code completion.\nOur results demonstrate that visual code compression serves as a viable alternative for tasks requiring global understanding. At comparable compression ratios ($\\sim$1.7$\\times$), LongCodeOCR improves CompScore on Long Module Summarization by 36.85 points over LongCodeZip. At a 1M-token context length with Glyph (a specialized 9B VLM), LongCodeOCR maintains higher accuracy than LongCodeZip while operating at about 4$\\times$ higher compression. Moreover, compared with LongCodeZip, LongCodeOCR drastically reduces compression-stage overhead (reducing latency from $\\sim$4.3 hours to $\\sim$1 minute at 1M tokens). Finally, our results characterize a fundamental coverage--fidelity trade-off: visual code compression retains broader context coverage to support global dependencies, yet faces fidelity bottlenecks on exactness-critical tasks; by contrast, textual code compression preserves symbol-level precision while sacrificing structural coverage.",

        "abstract": "Determining an effective data mixture is a key factor in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training, where models must balance general competence with proficiency on hard tasks such as math and code. However, identifying an optimal mixture remains an open challenge, as existing approaches either rely on unreliable tiny-scale proxy experiments or require prohibitively expensive large-scale exploration. To address this, we propose Decouple Searching from Training Mix (DeMix), a novel framework that leverages model merging to predict optimal data ratios. Instead of training proxy models for every sampled mixture, DeMix trains component models on candidate datasets at scale and derives data mixture proxies via weighted model merging. This paradigm decouples search from training costs, enabling evaluation of unlimited sampled mixtures without extra training burden and thus facilitating better mixture discovery through more search trials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMix breaks the trade-off between sufficiency, accuracy and efficiency, obtaining the optimal mixture with higher benchmark performance at lower search cost. Additionally, we release the DeMix Corpora, a comprehensive 22T-token dataset comprising high-quality pre-training data with validated mixtures to facilitate open research. Our code and DeMix Corpora is available at https://github.com/Lucius-lsr/DeMix.",

While emerging supernode architectures offer terabyte-scale shared memory pools via high-bandwidth interconnects, existing software stacks fail to exploit this hardware effectively. Current runtime-based offloading and swapping techniques operate with a local view, leading to reactive scheduling and exposed communication latency that stall the computation pipeline.\nIn this paper, we propose the SuperNode Memory Management Framework (\\textbf{HyperOffload}). It employs a compiler-assisted approach that leverages graph-driven memory management to treat remote memory access as explicit operations in the computation graph, specifically designed for hierarchical SuperNode architectures. Unlike reactive runtime systems, SuperNode represents data movement using cache operators within the compiler's Intermediate Representation (IR). This design enables a global, compile-time analysis of tensor lifetimes and execution dependencies. Leveraging this visibility, we develop a global execution-order refinement algorithm that statically schedules data transfers to hide remote memory latency behind compute-intensive regions. We implement SuperNode within the production deep learning framework MindSpore, adding a remote memory backend and specialized compiler passes. Evaluation on representative LLM workloads shows that SuperNode reduces peak device memory usage by up to 26\\% for inference while maintaining end-to-end performance. Our work demonstrates that integrating memory-augmented hardware into the compiler's optimization framework is essential for scaling next-generation AI workloads.",

Existing generative approaches for HSI restoration like diffusion models require hundreds of iterative steps, making them computationally impractical for high-dimensional HSIs. While regression models tend to produce oversmoothed results, failing to preserve critical structural details. We break this impasse by introducing HSI-VAR, rethinking HSI restoration as an autoregressive generation problem, where spectral and spatial dependencies can be progressively modeled rather than globally reconstructed. HSI-VAR incorporates three key innovations: (1) Latent-condition alignment, which couples semantic consistency between latent priors and conditional embeddings for precise reconstruction; (2) Degradation-aware guidance, which uniquely encodes mixed degradations as linear combinations in the embedding space for automatic control, remarkably achieving a nearly $50\\%$ reduction in computational cost at inference; (3) A spatial-spectral adaptation module that refines details across both domains in the decoding phase. Extensive experiments on nine all-in-one HSI restoration benchmarks confirm HSI-VAR's state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 3.77 dB PSNR improvement on \\textbf{\\textit{ICVL}} and offering superior structure preservation with an inference speed-up of up to $95.5 \\times$ compared with diffusion-based methods, making it a highly practical solution for real-world HSI restoration.",

Recent work has shown that linear probes trained on activation deltas of LLMs' hidden layers can effectively detect such drift. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of these detectors against adversarially optimised suffixes. We generate universal suffixes that cause poisoned inputs to evade detection across multiple probes simultaneously. Our experiments on Phi-3 3.8B and Llama-3 8B show that a single suffix can achieve high attack success rates; up to 93.91% and 99.63%, respectively, when all probes must be fooled, and nearly perfect success (>90%) under majority vote setting. These results demonstrate that activation delta-based task drift detectors are highly vulnerable to adversarial suffixes, highlighting the need for stronger defences against adaptive attacks. We also propose a defence technique where we generate multiple suffixes and randomly append one of them to the prompts while making forward passes of the LLM and train logistic regression models with these activations. We found this approach to be highly effective against such attacks.",

Adversarial constitutions lead to societal collapse (S= 0), while vague prosocial principles (\"be helpful, harmless, honest\") produce inconsistent coordination (S = 0.249).

Scratch programs exhibit deeply nested, non-linear structures, event-driven concurrency across multiple sprites, and tight coupling between code and multimedia assets, properties that differ fundamentally from textual code. As a result, LLMs often misinterpret Scratch semantics and generate large, invasive edits that are syntactically valid but semantically incorrect when repairing buggy programs.\nWe introduce ScratchEval, the first executable benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair for Scratch programs, covering program understanding, debugging, analysis, and repair. The benchmark contains 100 curated Scratch projects from the public repository, selected for structural and semantic complexity. Each project is paired with executable test suites, bug descriptions with corresponding fixes, block-level edit constraints defining minimal semantically correct repairs, and required multimedia assets. The benchmark is constructed through a human-in-the-loop pipeline combining automated project mining with expert validation of trigger-outcome semantics and representative bug patterns, with emphasis on event ordering, concurrency, and state management.\nTo enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we propose a three-layer executable protocol measuring functional correctness via VM-level execution, repair quality using block-level edit distance and behavioral trajectory comparisons, and explanation quality via structured rubrics assessing alignment between model reasoning and generated patches. Using ScratchEval, we study domain-specific fine-tuning, training data effectiveness, and model generalization to unseen bug types.

To provide additional information for the RLVR process without relying on a teacher model, we propose A$^2$D, an Adaptive Ability Decomposing method for enhancing the effectiveness of RLVR. Specifically, we first train a decomposer via RLVR without distillation, enabling it to decompose complex questions into a set of simpler sub-questions. Next, we use this decomposer to annotate sub-questions for each question in the training dataset, and then train the reasoner under RLVR with sub-question guidance. To better understand A$^2$D, we first compare its performance with competitive baselines, showing its effectiveness. Next, we observe that our method functions as a plug-and-play module that can be applied to different RLVR algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis of the decomposer, revealing how the RLVR process affects its performance and behavior, and which type of guidance is better suited for enhancing the reasoner's exploration and exploitation abilities.",

We formally define this specific position where the answer first stabilizes as the Reasoning Anchor. By analyzing pre- and post-anchor reasoning behaviors, we uncover the structural redundancy fixed in LRMs: the meaningless repetitive verification after deriving the first complete answer, which we term the Answer-Stable Tail (AST). Motivated by this observation, we propose Anchor-based Process Reward (APR), a structure-aware reward shaping method that localizes the reasoning anchor and penalizes exclusively the post-anchor AST.

In this work, we propose a unified agentic NetGPT framework for AI-native xG networks, wherein a NetGPT core can either perform autonomous reasoning or delegate sub-tasks to domain-specialized agents via agentic communication. The framework establishes clear modular responsibilities and interoperable workflows, enabling scalable, distributed intelligence across the network. To support continual refinement of collaborative reasoning strategies, the framework is further enhanced through Agentic reinforcement learning under partially observable conditions and stochastic external states. The training pipeline incorporates masked loss against external agent uncertainty, entropy-guided exploration, and multi-objective rewards that jointly capture task quality, coordination efficiency, and resource constraints. Through this process, NetGPT learns when and how to collaborate, effectively balancing internal reasoning with agent invocation.

Here, we propose a novel elicitation method based on iterated in-context learning (Zhu and Griffiths, 2024a) and apply it to elicit trustworthiness priors using the Trust Game from behavioral game theory. The Trust Game is particularly well suited for this purpose because it operationalizes trust as voluntary exposure to risk based on beliefs about another agent, rather than self-reported attitudes. Using our method, we elicit trustworthiness priors from several leading large language models (LLMs) and find that GPT-4.1's trustworthiness priors closely track those observed in humans. Building on this result, we further examine how GPT-4.1 responds to different player personas in the Trust Game, providing an initial characterization of how such models differentiate trust across agent characteristics. Finally, we show that variation in elicited trustworthiness can be well predicted by a stereotype-based model grounded in perceived warmth and competence.",

To address this opacity, we introduce a representational perspective to investigate the dynamics of the model's internal states. Through comprehensive experiments across models at various training stages, we discover that post-training yields only limited improvement in static initial representation quality. Furthermore, we reveal that, distinct from non-reasoning tasks, reasoning involves a significant continuous distributional shift in representations during generation. Comparative analysis indicates that post-training empowers models to drive this transition toward a better distribution for task solving. To clarify the relationship between internal states and external outputs, statistical analysis confirms a high correlation between generation correctness and the final representations; while counterfactual experiments identify the semantics of the generated tokens, rather than additional computation during inference or intrinsic parameter differences, as the dominant driver of the transition. Collectively, we offer a novel understanding of the reasoning process and the effect of training on reasoning enhancement, providing valuable insights for future model analysis and optimization.",

Thematic analysis reveals that resistance stems from two core investments: instrumental dependency, where the AI is deeply integrated into professional workflows, and relational attachment, where users form strong parasocial bonds with the AI as a unique companion. Quantitative analysis further shows that the coercive deprivation of user choice was a key catalyst, transforming individual grievances into a collective, rights-based protest. This study illuminates an emerging form of socio-technical conflict in the age of generative AI. Our findings suggest that for AI systems designed for companionship and deep integration, the process of change--particularly the preservation of user agency--can be as critical as the technological outcome itself.",

Their environmental performance directly affects regional ecological security and is closely tied to national resource strategies and green transformation outcomes. Ensuring the authenticity and reliability of their environmental disclosure is thus a core and urgent issue for sustainable development and national strategic http://objectives.From a corporate governance perspective, this study examines equity balance as a fundamental governance mechanism, investigating its inhibitory effect on greenwashing behavior among these enterprises and the underlying pathways involved. Methodologically, the paper innovatively employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Double Machine Learning (DML) model to construct counterfactual scenarios, mitigating endogeneity concerns and precisely identifying the causal relationship between equity balance and greenwashing. The findings indicate, first, a significant negative causal relationship between equity balance and corporate greenwashing, confirming its substantive governance effect. Second, this inhibitory effect exhibits notable heterogeneity, manifesting more strongly in western regions, upstream segments of the industrial chain, and industries with high environmental sensitivity. Third, the governance effect demonstrates clear temporal dynamics, with the strongest impact occurring in the current period, followed by a diminishing yet statistically significant lagged effect, and ultimately a stable long-term cumulative influence. Finally, mechanism analysis reveals that equity balance operates through three distinct channels to curb greenwashing: alleviating management performance pressure, enhancing the stability of the executive team, and intensifying media scrutiny.",

In this paper, we introduce {\\bf HyLRA} ({\\bf Hy}brid {\\bf L}ayer {\\bf R}euse {\\bf A}ttention), a novel framework driven by layer-wise sparsity profiling.

Based on these observations, HyLRA employs an offline dynamic programming approach to derive an optimal layer-wise policy. This hybrid strategy retains full attention for sensitive layers to ensure robustness, while enabling tolerant layers to bypass quadratic calculations by directly reusing top-$k$ indices from preceding layers. This approach allows LLMs to restrict computation to the most critical tokens, effectively overcoming the quadratic bottleneck of dense attention. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that HyLRA improves inference throughput by 6\\%--46\\% while maintaining comparable performance (with $<1\\%$ accuracy degradation), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art sparse attention methods.

However, these successes have not translated to complex domains where the cost of interaction is high, such as the physical cost of running robots, the time cost of ML engineering, and the resource cost of scientific experiments. The true bottleneck for achieving the next level of agent performance for these complex and high-cost domains lies in the expense of executing actions to acquire reward signals. To address this gap, this paper argues that we should use world models as an intermediary between agents and the real world. We discuss how world models, viewed as models of dynamics, rewards, and task distributions, can overcome fundamental barriers of high-cost actions such as extreme off-policy learning and sample inefficiency in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how world models can provide critical and rich learning signals to agents across a broad set of domains, including machine learning engineering, computer use, robotics, and AI for science. Lastly, we identify the challenges of building these world models and propose actionable items along dataset curation, architecture design, scaling, and evaluation of world models.",

The central task of an MFBO policy is to balance the cost-efficiency of low-fidelity proxies against their reduced accuracy to ensure effective progression toward the high-fidelity optimum. Existing MFBO methods primarily capture associational dependencies between inputs, fidelities, and objectives, rather than causal mechanisms, and can perform poorly when lower-fidelity proxies are poorly aligned with the target fidelity. We propose RESCUE (REducing Sampling cost with Causal Understanding and Estimation), a multi-objective MFBO method that incorporates causal calculus to systematically address this challenge. RESCUE learns a structural causal model capturing causal relationships between inputs, fidelities, and objectives, and uses it to construct a probabilistic multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate that encodes intervention effects. Exploiting the causal structure, we introduce a causal hypervolume knowledge-gradient acquisition strategy to select input-fidelity pairs that balance expected multi-objective improvement and cost. We show that RESCUE improves sample efficiency over state-of-the-art MF optimization methods on synthetic and real-world problems in robotics, machine learning (AutoML), and healthcare.",

While diffusion duality enables deterministic distillation for uniform models, these approaches generally underperform masked models and rely on complex integral operators. Conversely, in the masked domain, prior methods typically assume the absence of deterministic trajectories, forcing a reliance on stochastic distillation. To bridge this gap, we establish explicit Masked Diffusion Duality, proving that the masked process arises as the projection of a continuous Gaussian process via a novel maximum-value index preservation mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce Masked Consistency Distillation (MCD), a principled framework that leverages this duality to analytically construct the deterministic coupled trajectories required for consistency distillation, bypassing numerical ODE solvers. This result strictly improves upon prior stochastic distillation methods, achieving a 16$\\times$ inference speedup without compromising generation quality. Our findings not only provide a solid theoretical foundation connecting masked and continuous diffusion, but also unlock the full potential of consistency distillation for high-performance discrete generation.

Recent approaches incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual representations with semantic embeddings derived from class names. However, they overlook progressive and adaptive alignment between vision and language from low-level to high-level semantics, resulting in limited semantic gains. To address these challenges, we propose Dual-level Vision-Language Alignment with Reinforcement Learning gating (DVLA-RL), which consists of Dual-level Semantic Construction (DSC) and RL-gated Attention (RLA). Specifically, DSC conditions LLMs on both class names and support samples to generate discriminative attributes, progressively selects the most relevant ones, and then synthesizes them into coherent class descriptions. This process provides complementary low-level attributes and high-level descriptions, enabling both fine-grained grounding and holistic class understanding. To dynamically integrate dual-level semantics along with the visual network layers, RLA formulates cross-modal fusion as a sequential decision process. A lightweight policy trained with episodic REINFORCE adaptively adjusts the contributions of self-attention and cross-attention to integrate textual and visual tokens. As a result, shallow layers refine local attributes and deep layers emphasize global semantics, enabling more precise cross-modal alignment. This achieves class-specific discrimination and generalized representations with merely a few support samples. DVLA-RL achieves new state-of-the-art performance across nine benchmarks in three diverse FSL scenarios.",

While MoE decouples capacity from compute, it introduces large memory overhead and hardware efficiency challenges. To overcome these, we propose token-indexed parameters as a novel, orthogonal scaling axis that decouple model capacity from FLOPs. Specifically, we introduce Joint-Token (JTok) and Mixture of Joint-Token (JTok-M), which augment Transformer layers with modulation vectors retrieved from auxiliary embedding tables. These vectors modulate the backbone via lightweight, element-wise operations, incurring negligible FLOPs overhead. Extensive experiments on both dense and MoE backbones, spanning from 650M (190M + 460M embedding) to 61B (17B + 44B embedding) total parameters, demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces validation loss and significantly improves downstream task performance (e.g., +4.1 on MMLU, +8.3 on ARC, +8.9 on CEval). Rigorous isoFLOPs analysis further confirms that JTok-M fundamentally shifts the quality-compute Pareto frontier, achieving comparable model quality with 35% less compute relative to vanilla MoE architectures, and we validate that token-indexed parameters exhibit a predictable power-law scaling behavior. Moreover, our efficient implementation ensures that the overhead introduced by JTok and JTok-M remains marginal.",

First, we introduce a Diffusion Mamba Transformer architecture that embeds mamba and attention into the diffusion process, enabling more effective aggregation of sequential input contexts from sensor streams and past motion histories. Second, we design a Port-Hamiltonian Neural Network module that seamlessly integrates energy-based physical constraints into the diffusion model, thereby enhancing trajectory predictions with both consistency and interpretability.

The text specifies how to alter the reference image to form a ``mental image'', based on which CIR should find the target image in the database. The fundamental challenge of CIR is that this ``mental image'' is not physically available and is only implicitly defined by the query. The contemporary literature pursues zero-shot methods and uses a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to generate a textual description for a given multimodal query, and then employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for textual-visual matching to search the target image. In contrast, we address CIR from first principles by directly generating the ``mental image'' for more accurate matching. Particularly, we prompt an LMM to generate a ``mental image'' for a given multimodal query and propose to use this ``mental image'' to search for the target image. As the ``mental image'' has a synthetic-to-real domain gap with real images, we also generate a synthetic counterpart for each real image in the database to facilitate matching. In this sense, our method uses LMM to construct a ``paracosm'', where it matches the multimodal query and database images. Hence, we call this method Paracosm. Notably, Paracosm is a training-free zero-shot CIR method. It significantly outperforms existing zero-shot methods on four challenging benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot CIR.",

In this work, we revisit the fundamental question of data and compute efficiency in RLVR. We first establish a theoretical lower bound on the sample complexity required to unlock reasoning capabilities, and empirically validate that strong performance can be achieved with a surprisingly small number of training instances. To tackle the computational burden, we propose Dynamic One-Shot Policy Refinement (DoPR), an uncertainty-aware RL strategy that dynamically selects a single informative training sample per batch for policy updates, guided by reward volatility and exploration-driven acquisition. DoPR reduces rollout overhead by nearly an order of magnitude while preserving competitive reasoning accuracy, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for LLM post-training. This approach offers a practical path toward more efficient and accessible RL-based training for reasoning-intensive LLM applications.",

By leveraging inversion-free Rectified Flow Transformers (FlowEdit), the system performs high-fidelity identity transformation in near real-time (less than 20s), facilitating local deployment on clinical nodes. We introduce a \"Segment-by-Synthesis\" mechanism that generates counterfactual healthy and pathological twin pairs locally. This enables the extraction of differential erythema masks that are decoupled from biometric markers and semantic artifacts (e.g. jewelry). Pilot validation on high-resolution clinical samples demonstrates an Intersection over Union (IoU) stability greater than 0.67 across synthetic identities.

However, these studies focused mostly on the correctness and safety of the translated code, which are indeed critical, but they left other important quality concerns (e.g., performance, robustness, and maintainability) largely unexplored. This work investigates strengths and weaknesses of three C-to-Rust translators, namely C2Rust (a transpiler), C2SaferRust (an LLM-guided transpiler), and TranslationGym (an LLM-based direct translation). We perform an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of several important quality attributes for the translated Rust code of the popular GNU coreutils, using human-based translation as a baseline. To assess the internal and external quality of the Rust code, we: (i) apply Clippy, a rule-based state-of-the-practice Rust static analysis tool; (ii) investigate the capability of an LLM (GPT-4o) to identify issues potentially overlooked by Clippy; and (iii) perform a manual analysis of the issues reported by Clippy and GPT-4o. Our results show that while newer techniques reduce some unsafe and non-idiomatic patterns, they frequently introduce new issues, revealing systematic trade-offs that are not visible under existing evaluation practices. Notably, none of the automated techniques consistently match or exceed human-written translations across all quality dimensions, yet even human-written Rust code exhibits persistent internal quality issues such as readability and non-idiomatic patterns. Together, these findings show that translation quality remains a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring systematic evaluation and targeted tool support beyond both naive automation and manual rewriting.",

        "abstract": "Agentic reasoning enables large reasoning models (LRMs) to dynamically acquire external knowledge, but yet optimizing the retrieval process remains challenging due to the lack of dense, principled reward signals. In this paper, we introduce InfoReasoner, a unified framework that incentivizes effective information seeking via a synthetic semantic information gain reward. Theoretically, we redefine information gain as uncertainty reduction over the model's belief states, establishing guarantees, including non-negativity, telescoping additivity, and channel monotonicity. Practically, to enable scalable optimization without manual retrieval annotations, we propose an output-aware intrinsic estimator that computes information gain directly from the model's output distributions using semantic clustering via bidirectional textual entailment. This intrinsic reward guides the policy to maximize epistemic progress, enabling efficient training via Group Relative Policy Optimxization (GRPO). Experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that InfoReasoner consistently outperforms strong retrieval-augmented baselines, achieving up to 5.4% average accuracy improvement. Our work provides a theoretically grounded and scalable path toward agentic reasoning with retrieval.",

A critical bottleneck remains the lack of effective reward models (RMs): existing RMs are predominantly vision-centric, return opaque scalar scores, and rely on costly human annotations. We introduce \\textbf{Omni-RRM}, the first open-source rubric-grounded reward model that produces structured, multi-dimension preference judgments with dimension-wise justifications across \\textbf{text, image, video, and audio}. At the core of our approach is \\textbf{Omni-Preference}, a large-scale dataset built via a fully automated pipeline: we synthesize candidate response pairs by contrasting models of different capabilities, and use strong teacher models to \\emph{reconcile and filter} preferences while providing a modality-aware \\emph{rubric-grounded rationale} for each pair. This eliminates the need for human-labeled training preferences. Omni-RRM is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning to learn the rubric-grounded outputs, followed by reinforcement learning (GRPO) to sharpen discrimination on difficult, low-contrast pairs. Comprehensive evaluations show that Omni-RRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on video (80.2\\% on ShareGPT-V) and audio (66.8\\% on Audio-HH-RLHF) benchmarks, and substantially outperforms existing open-source RMs on image tasks, with a 17.7\\% absolute gain over its base model on overall accuracy. Omni-RRM also improves downstream performance via Best-of-$N$ selection and transfers to text-only preference benchmarks.

However, acquiring sufficient real student response data for a robust evaluation is often hindered by cost, ethics, and security constraints. Consequently, LLM-based student proficiency simulation, especially prompt-based methods, has emerged as a practical alternative under data-scarce conditions. Despite their promise, current methods still exhibit limited controllability with coarse-grained proficiency representations, high sensitivity to prompt design, and the lack of calibration with academic performance. Therefore, we propose Parameterized Student Proficiency Simulation (PS$^2$), an unsupervised and parameterized model-level framework that simulates students with different proficiencies by interpolating between a strong upper-bound LLM and a weaker, cognitive error-informed lower-bound student LLM via a hybrid ratio. Specifically, the lower-bound model is constructed by fine-tuning the weaker LM to exhibit cognitive errors when responding to educational materials. To ensure alignment with target proficiency levels, PS$^2$ further calibrates the interpolation ratio with academic performance. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that PS$^2$ achieves finer-grained and consistent proficiency simulation compared to existing baselines, leading to superior performance in student behavior similarity and item difficulty prediction.",

Unlike open-ended generation, text scoring failures are directly testable: an attack succeeds when an irrelevant or rejected text outscores a relevant or chosen one. Using this principled lens of text scoring, we demonstrate that current adversarial training formulations for language models are often short-sighted, failing to effectively generalize across attacks. To address this, we introduce multiple adversarial training methods for text scoring models and show that combining complementary training methods can yield strong robustness while also improving task effectiveness. We also highlight the practical value of our approach for RLHF, showing that our adversarially trained reward models mitigate reward hacking and support the training of better-aligned LLMs. We provide our code and models for further study.",

We formalize this gap: cross-entropy training induces an implicit potential game among heads, and gradient descent converges to Nash equilibria with potentially unbounded inefficiency due to unpriced externalities (redundancy, correlated errors). Our main result bounds the Price of Anarchy by $\\Gamma(G)$, the off-diagonal mass of a head interaction matrix capturing weight and gradient coupling. Under mild smoothness assumptions, we prove that both \\emph{excess hallucination probability} and \\emph{excess head redundancy} scale with PoA, unifying two distinct failure modes into a single mechanism. The bound is prescriptive: regularization that reduces $\\Gamma(G)$ provably tightens PoA. We instantiate this as GAME-LoRA, combining Barlow Twins decorrelation with log-determinant coordination pressure. Experiments validate the theory: $\\Gamma(G)$ predicts hallucination ($p{<}0.05$), emergent coalitions exhibit selective coordination, and GAME-LoRA achieves up to 18\\% hallucination reduction (8\\% average) with no knowledge degradation -- a Pareto improvement inaccessible to methods ignoring the game structure.",

To address this critical gap, we propose Safe Stochastic Explorer (http://S.S.Explorer) a novel framework for safe, goal-driven exploration under stochastic dynamics. Our approach strategically balances safety and information gathering to reduce uncertainty about safety in the unknown environment. We employ Gaussian Processes to learn the unknown safety function online, leveraging their predictive uncertainty to guide information-gathering actions and provide probabilistic bounds on safety violations. We first present our method for discrete state space environments and then introduce a scalable relaxation to effectively extend this approach to continuous state spaces. Finally we demonstrate how this framework can be naturally applied to ensure safe physical interaction with multiple unknown objects. Extensive validation in simulation and demonstrative hardware experiments showcase the efficacy of our method, representing a step forward toward enabling reliable widespread robot autonomy in complex, uncertain environments.",

However, CFM is insufficient to ensure accuracy in learning probability paths. In this paper, we introduce a new partial differential equation characterization for the error between the learned and exact probability paths, along with its solution. We show that the total variation gap between the two probability paths is bounded above by a combination of the CFM loss and an associated divergence loss. This theoretical insight leads to the design of a new objective function that simultaneously matches the flow and its divergence. Our new approach improves the performance of the flow-based generative model by a noticeable margin without sacrificing generation efficiency. We showcase the advantages of this enhanced training approach over CFM on several important benchmark tasks, including generative modeling for dynamical systems, DNA sequences, and videos.

However, most existing approaches operate at the level of output critique, patching surface errors while often failing to correct deeper reasoning flaws. We propose SELF-THOUGHT, a framework that introduces an intermediate step of task abstraction before solution refinement. Given an input and an initial response, the model first distills the task into a structured template that captures key variables, constraints, and problem structure. This abstraction then guides solution instantiation, grounding subsequent responses in a clearer understanding of the task and reducing error propagation. Crucially, we show that these abstractions can be transferred across models: templates generated by larger models can serve as structured guides for smaller LLMs, which typically struggle with intrinsic self-correction. By reusing distilled task structures, smaller models achieve more reliable refinements without heavy fine-tuning or reliance on external verifiers. Experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that SELF-THOUGHT improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization for both large and small models, offering a scalable path toward more reliable self-correcting language systems.",

For instance, crossing a ditch may be risky at a low speed due to the risk of getting stuck, yet safe at a higher speed with a controlled, accelerated jump. Achieving such behavior requires path planning that explicitly models complex motion dynamics, whereas existing methods often neglect this aspect and plan solely based on positions or a fixed velocity. To address this gap, we introduce Motion-aware Traversability (MAT) representation to explicitly model terrain cost conditioned on actual robot motion. Instead of assigning a single scalar score for traversability, MAT models each terrain region as a Gaussian function of velocity. During online planning, we decompose the terrain cost computation into two stages: (1) predict terrain-dependent Gaussian parameters from perception in a single forward pass, (2) efficiently update terrain costs for new velocities inferred from current dynamics by evaluating these functions without repeated inference. We develop a system that integrates MAT to enable agile off-road navigation and evaluate it in both simulated and real-world environments with various obstacles. Results show that MAT achieves real-time efficiency and enhances the performance of off-road navigation, reducing path detours by 75% while maintaining safety across challenging terrains.",

However, their integration with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures is constrained by an expert explosion: as the number of tokens generated in parallel increases, the number of distinct experts activated grows nearly linearly. This results in substantial memory traffic that pushes inference into a memory-bound regime, negating the efficiency gains of both MoE and parallel decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Expert Sharing (DES), a novel technique that shifts MoE optimization from token-centric pruning and conventional expert skipping methods to sequence-level coreset selection. To maximize expert reuse, DES identifies a compact, high-utility set of experts to satisfy the requirements of an entire parallel decoding block. We introduce two innovative selection strategies: (1) Intra-Sequence Sharing (DES-Seq), which adapts optimal allocation to the sequence level, and (2) Saliency-Aware Voting (DES-Vote), a novel mechanism that allows tokens to collectively elect a coreset based on aggregated router weights. Extensive experiments on MoE dLLMs demonstrate that DES reduces unique expert activations by over 55% and latency by up to 38%, while retaining 99% of vanilla accuracy, effectively decoupling memory overhead from the degree of parallelism.",

To address these limitations, we propose DIAMOND, a training-free method that applies trajectory correction to mitigate artifacts during inference. By reconstructing an estimate of the clean sample at every step of the generative trajectory, DIAMOND actively steers the generation process away from latent states that lead to artifacts. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to standard Diffusion Models, demonstrating that DIAMOND provides a robust, zero-shot path to high-fidelity, artifact-free image synthesis without the need for additional training or weight modifications in modern generative architectures.

This presumption prohibits their use under partial storage outage, imperfect communication, and stochastic access failures. Furthermore, we show that the original formulation collapses under such conditions.

The resulting objective facilitates robust selection of diverse data batches under uncertainty.

RoDiF reinterprets the DPO objective through a geometric hypothesis-cutting perspective and employs a conservative cutting strategy to achieve robustness without assuming any specific noise distribution. Extensive experiments on long-horizon manipulation tasks show that RoDiF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively steering pretrained diffusion policies of diverse architectures to human-preferred modes, while maintaining strong performance even under 30% corrupted preference labels.",

While powerful, this approach faces several limitations including high token costs and privacy concerns for sensitive applications. We introduce effGen, an open-source agentic framework optimized for small language models (SLMs) that enables effective, efficient, and secure local deployment (pip install effgen). effGen makes four major contributions: (1) Enhanced tool-calling with prompt optimization that compresses contexts by 70-80% while preserving task semantics, (2) Intelligent task decomposition that breaks complex queries into parallel or sequential subtasks based on dependencies, (3) Complexity-based routing using five factors to make smart pre-execution decisions, and (4) Unified memory system combining short-term, long-term, and vector-based storage. Additionally, effGen unifies multiple agent protocols (MCP, A2A, ACP) for cross-protocol communication. Results on 13 benchmarks show effGen outperforms LangChain, AutoGen, and Smolagents with higher success rates, faster execution, and lower memory. Our results reveal that prompt optimization and complexity routing have complementary scaling behavior: optimization benefits SLMs more (11.2% gain at 1.5B vs 2.4% at 32B), while routing benefits large models more (3.6% at 1.5B vs 7.9% at 32B), providing consistent gains across all scales when combined. effGen (https://effgen.org/) is released under the MIT License, ensuring broad accessibility for research and commercial use.

        "abstract": "State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to transformers due to their unique ability of modeling global relationships in text with linear complexity. However, their success in vision tasks has been limited due to their causal formulation, which is suitable for sequential text but detrimental in the spatial domain where causality breaks the inherent spatial relationships among pixels or patches. As a result, standard SSMs fail to capture local spatial coherence, often linking non-adjacent patches while ignoring neighboring ones that are visually correlated. To address these limitations, we introduce OCTOPUS , a novel architecture that preserves both global context and local spatial structure within images, while maintaining the linear complexity of SSMs. OCTOPUS performs discrete reoccurrence along eight principal orientations, going forward or backward in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, allowing effective information exchange across all spatially connected regions while maintaining independence among unrelated patches. This design enables multi-directional recurrence, capturing both global context and local spatial structure with SSM-level efficiency. In our classification and segmentation benchmarks, OCTOPUS demonstrates notable improvements in boundary preservation and region consistency, as evident from the segmentation results, while maintaining relatively better classification accuracy compared to existing V-SSM based models. These results suggest that OCTOPUS appears as a foundation method for multi-directional recurrence as a scalable and effective mechanism for building spatially aware and computationally efficient vision architectures.",

This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified \"closed world\" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.",

We study this under a strict compute-frugal budget (single 8 GB GPU) on ValueEval'24 / ValuesML (74K English sentences). We compare (i) direct supervised transformers, (ii) HO$\\rightarrow$values pipelines that enforce the hierarchy with hard masks, and (iii) Presence$\\rightarrow$HO$\\rightarrow$values cascades, alongside low-cost add-ons (lexica, short context, topics), label-wise threshold tuning, small instruction-tuned LLM baselines ($\\le$10B), QLoRA, and simple ensembles. HO categories are learnable from single sentences (e.g., the easiest bipolar pair reaches Macro-$F_1\\approx0.58$), but hard hierarchical gating is not a reliable win: it often reduces end-task Macro-$F_1$ via error compounding and recall suppression. In contrast, label-wise threshold tuning is a high-leverage knob (up to $+0.05$ Macro-$F_1$), and small transformer ensembles provide the most consistent additional gains (up to $+0.02$ Macro-$F_1$). Small LLMs lag behind supervised encoders as stand-alone systems, yet can contribute complementary errors in cross-family ensembles. Overall, HO structure is useful descriptively, but enforcing it with hard gates hurts sentence-level value detection; robust improvements come from calibration and lightweight ensembling.",

The proposed approach maps grasps from diverse robotic hands into a unified human-like canonical hand pose representation, providing a common space for learning. Grasp generation is then conditioned on structured representations of hand kinematics, encoded as graphs derived from hand configurations, together with object geometry. In addition, a loss function is introduced that exploits the hierarchical organization of hand kinematics to guide joint-level supervision.

Most existing ECTS methods assume that the time-dependent decision costs governing the learning objective are known, fixed, and correctly specified. In practice, however, these costs are often uncertain and may change over time, leading to mismatches between training-time and deployment-time objectives. In this paper, we study ECTS under two practically relevant forms of cost non-stationarity: drift in the balance between misclassification and decision delay costs, and stochastic realizations of decision costs that deviate from the nominal training-time model. To address these challenges, we revisit representative ECTS approaches and adapt them to an online learning setting. Focusing on separable methods, we update only the triggering model during deployment, while keeping the classifier fixed. We propose several online adaptations and baselines, including bandit-based and RL-based approaches, and conduct controlled experiments on synthetic data to systematically evaluate robustness under cost non-stationarity. Our results demonstrate that online learning can effectively improve the robustness of ECTS methods to cost drift, with RL-based strategies exhibiting strong and stable performance across varying cost regimes.",

By operating within this compact space, the proposed algorithm inherently yields smooth outputs with bounded prediction errors over local supports, naturally aligning with receding-horizon execution. Integration of an ESDF-based safety checker with explicit clearance and time-to-completion metrics further reduces the training burden associated with value-function learning for feasibility assessment. Experiments show that training with $500$ episodes (merely $0.25\\%$ of the demonstration scale used by the baseline), SanD-Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluated open benchmark, attaining success rates of $90.1\\%$ in simulated cluttered environments and $72.0\\%$ in indoor simulations.

Recent efforts pursue this in different ways, such as RL fine-tuning to elicit long CoT or scaling latent reasoning through architectural recurrence. This makes reasoning length an important scaling knob. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon (both theoretically and experimentally): under outcome-only supervision, out-of-distribution (OOD) performance can continue improving as training-time reasoning length (e.g., the token budget in RL, or the loop count in looped Transformers) increases, even after in-distribution (ID) performance has saturated. This suggests that robustness may require a larger budget than ID validation alone would indicate. We provide theoretical explanations via two mechanisms: (i) self-iteration can induce a stronger inductive bias in the hypothesis class, reshaping ID-optimal solutions in ways that improve OOD generalization; and (ii) when shortcut solutions that work for ID samples but not for OOD samples persist in the hypothesis class, regularization can reduce the learned solution's reliance on these shortcuts as the number of self-iterations increases. We complement the theory with empirical evidence from two realizations of scaling training-time reasoning length: increasing the number of loops in looped Transformers on a synthetic task, and increasing token budgets during RL fine-tuning of LLMs on mathematical reasoning.",

However, they heavily rely on human-provided abstractions and sidestep the abstraction-learning problem. We introduce TheoryCoder-2, a new TBRL agent that leverages LLMs' in-context learning ability to actively learn reusable abstractions rather than relying on hand-specified ones, by synthesizing abstractions from experience and integrating them into a hierarchical planning process. We conduct experiments on diverse environments, including BabyAI, Minihack and VGDL games like Sokoban.

We prove that learning with K strategies yields a Theta(K log K) improvement in sample complexity over binary preferences, and that DPO converges to the entropy-regularized utility-maximizing policy. To exploit this signal, we propose a two-stage training pipeline: (i) strategy selection, which optimizes the model to choose the best strategy for a given problem via best-vs-all comparisons, and (ii) execution refinement, which trains the model to correctly execute the selected strategy using margin-stratified pairs.

However, existing evaluations often fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios, relying on restricted toolsets, simplistic workflows, or subjective LLM-as-a-judge metrics. We introduce MCP-Atlas, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating tool-use competency, comprising 36 real MCP servers and 220 tools. It includes 1,000 tasks designed to assess tool-use competency in realistic, multi-step workflows. Tasks use natural language prompts that avoid naming specific tools or servers, requiring agents to identify and orchestrate 3-6 tool calls across multiple servers. We score tasks using a claims-based rubric that awards partial credit based on the factual claims satisfied in the model's final answer, complemented by internal diagnostics on tool discovery, parameterization, syntax, error recovery, and efficiency. Evaluation results on frontier models reveal that top models achieve pass rates exceeding 50%, with primary failures arising from inadequate tool usage and task understanding. We release the task schema, containerized harness, and a 500-task public subset of the benchmark dataset to facilitate reproducible comparisons and advance the development of robust, tool-augmented agents.",

However, such representations fail to capture the 3D spatial information about objects and scenes that is essential for precise manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Learning for 3D Multi-View Action-Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Pretraining (CLAMP), a novel 3D pre-training framework that utilizes point clouds and robot actions. From the merged point cloud computed from RGB-D images and camera extrinsics, we re-render multi-view four-channel image observations with depth and 3D coordinates, including dynamic wrist views, to provide clearer views of target objects for high-precision manipulation tasks. The pre-trained encoders learn to associate the 3D geometric and positional information of objects with robot action patterns via contrastive learning on large-scale simulated robot trajectories. During encoder pre-training, we pre-train a Diffusion Policy to initialize the policy weights for fine-tuning, which is essential for improving fine-tuning sample efficiency and performance. After pre-training, we fine-tune the policy on a limited amount of task demonstrations using the learned image and action representations. We demonstrate that this pre-training and fine-tuning design substantially improves learning efficiency and policy performance on unseen tasks. Furthermore, we show that CLAMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across six simulated tasks and five real-world tasks.",

Although existing offline ML-driven approaches accelerate TE optimization with deep neural networks (DNNs), they often lack sufficient expressiveness and generalization on unseen traffic patterns or topologies, limiting their practicality. Inspired by the success of large language models (LMs), for the first time, this paper investigates their potential as general-purpose traffic planners. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) Theoretically, we show that pre-trained LMs can simulate the sequential decision processes underlying TE and, crucially, exhibit parallel reasoning capabilities, making them well-suited for the task; (ii) Practically, we present LMTE, a novel LM-driven TE framework that embraces these insights through efficient multimodal alignment and lightweight configuration generation, all while preserving the model's original abilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fold matches top-tier performance on five datasets, achieving up to 15\\% better maximum link utilization (MLU) and consistently lower performance degradation across diverse scenarios, e.g., less than 5\\% with high traffic dynamics and link failures. Moreover, it achieves 10 to 100 times speedups over traditional TE solvers. To aid future works, our codebase is available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/LMTE.",

While sparse and low-rank structures naturally trade off capacity and performance, existing approaches often rely on heuristic designs that ignore layer and matrix heterogeneity or require model-specific architectural modifications. We propose SALAAD, a plug-and-play framework applicable to different model architectures that induces sparse and low-rank structures during training. By formulating structured weight learning under an augmented Lagrangian framework and introducing an adaptive controller that dynamically balances the training loss and structural constraints, SALAAD preserves the stability of standard training dynamics while enabling explicit control over the evolution of effective model capacity during training. Experiments across model scales show that SALAAD substantially reduces memory consumption during deployment while achieving performance comparable to ad-hoc methods. Moreover, a single training run yields a continuous spectrum of model capacities, enabling smooth and elastic deployment across diverse memory budgets without the need for retraining.",

We argue that language defaultness is governed by a sparse, low-rank control circuit, language neurons, that can be mechanistically isolated and safely steered.\nWe introduce Neural FOXP2, that makes a chosen language (Hindi or Spanish) primary in a model by steering language-specific neurons. Neural FOXP2 proceeds in three stages: (i) Localize: We train per-layer SAEs so each activation decomposes into a small set of active feature components. For every feature, we quantify English vs. Hindi/Spanish selectivity overall logit-mass lift toward the target-language token set. Tracing the top-ranked features back to their strongest contributing units yields a compact language-neuron set. (ii) Steering directions: We localize controllable language-shift geometry via a spectral low-rank analysis. For each layer, we build English to target activation-difference matrices and perform layerwise SVD to extract the dominant singular directions governing language change. The eigengap and effective-rank spectra identify a compact steering subspace and an empirically chosen intervention window (where these directions are strongest and most stable). (iii) Steer: We apply a signed, sparse activation shift targeted to the language neurons. Concretely, within low to mid layers we add a positive steering along the target-language dominant directions and a compensating negative shift toward the null space for the English neurons, yielding controllable target-language defaultness.",

We show that neither signal alone is sufficient: fusing them consistently improves performance compared to unimodal visual token selection (ranking).

We propose \\textbf{ConsensusDrop}, a training-free framework that derives a \\emph{consensus} ranking by reconciling vision encoder saliency with query-aware cross-attention, retaining the most informative tokens while compressing the remainder via encoder-guided token merging. Across LLaVA-1.5/NeXT, Video-LLaVA, and other open-source VLMs, ConsensusDrop consistently outperforms prior pruning methods under identical token budgets and delivers a stronger accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier -- preserving near-baseline accuracy even at aggressive token reductions while reducing TTFT and KV cache footprint.

A common heuristic treats small-margin (ambiguous) pairs as noisy and filters them out. In this paper, we revisit this assumption and show that pair difficulty interacts strongly with the optimization objective: when trained with preference-based losses, difficult pairs can destabilize training and harm alignment, yet these same pairs still contain useful supervision signals when optimized with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose MixDPO, a simple yet effective difficulty-aware training strategy that (i) orders preference data from easy to hard (a curriculum over margin-defined difficulty), and (ii) routes difficult pairs to an SFT objective while applying a preference loss to easy pairs. This hybrid design provides a practical mechanism to leverage ambiguous pairs without incurring the optimization failures often associated with preference losses on low-margin data. Across three LLM-judge benchmarks, MixDPO consistently improves alignment over DPO and a range of widely-used variants, with particularly strong gains on AlpacaEval~2 length-controlled (LC) win rate.",

To ensure the quality of extracted knowledge, we introduce a three-stage knowledge processing pipeline that combines vector-based filtering to remove exact duplicates, LLM-based adjudication to resolve ambiguous semantic overlaps, and domain-relevance auditing to retain valid knowledge units. Through extensive experiments, we find that recursive taxonomy is the most effective exploration strategy. We also observe a clear knowledge scaling law, where larger models consistently extract more knowledge. In addition, we identify a Pass@1-versus-Pass@k trade-off: domain-specialized models achieve higher initial accuracy but degrade rapidly, while general-purpose models maintain stable performance during extended extraction. Finally, our results show that differences in training data composition lead to distinct and measurable knowledge profiles across model families.",

We demonstrate that Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) provide a principled yet largely overlooked alternative for multimodal uncertainty quantification in SciML. As explicit parametric density estimators, MDNs impose an inductive bias tailored to low-dimensional, multimodal physics, enabling direct global allocation of probability mass across distinct solution branches. This structure delivers strong data efficiency, allowing reliable recovery of separated modes in regimes where scientific data is scarce. We formalize these insights through a unified probabilistic framework contrasting explicit and implicit distribution networks, and demonstrate empirically that MDNs achieve superior generalization, interpretability, and sample efficiency across a range of inverse, multistable, and chaotic scientific regression tasks.",

We derive theoretical bounds showing that uniform quantization introduces a noise floor that disproportionately truncates this spectral tail, which induces spectral flattening and a strictly provable increase in the stable rank of representations.

Current approaches in this domain present a clear trade-off: PPO-style methods (e.g., GRPO/DAPO) offer training stability but exhibit slow learning trajectories due to their trust-region constraints on policy updates, while REINFORCE-style approaches (e.g., CISPO) demonstrate improved learning efficiency but suffer from performance instability as they clip importance sampling weights while still permitting non-zero gradients outside the trust-region. To address these limitations, we introduce DISPO, a simple yet effective REINFORCE-style algorithm that decouples the up-clipping and down-clipping of importance sampling weights for correct and incorrect responses, yielding four controllable policy update regimes. Through targeted ablations, we uncover how each regime impacts training: for correct responses, weights >1 increase the average token entropy (i.e., exploration) while weights <1 decrease it (i.e., distillation) -- both beneficial but causing gradual performance degradation when excessive. For incorrect responses, overly restrictive clipping triggers sudden performance collapse through repetitive outputs (when weights >1) or vanishing response lengths (when weights <1). By separately tuning these four clipping parameters, DISPO maintains the exploration-distillation balance while preventing catastrophic failures, achieving 61.04% on AIME'24 (vs. 55.42% CISPO and 50.21% DAPO) with similar gains across various benchmarks and models.",

We demonstrate that this subsystem contains value neurons that represent the model's internal expectation of state value, and through intervention experiments, we establish the importance of these neurons for reasoning. Our experiments reveal that these value neurons are robust across diverse datasets, model scales, and architectures; furthermore, they exhibit significant transferability across different datasets and models fine-tuned from the same base model. By examining cases where value predictions and actual rewards diverge, we identify dopamine neurons within the reward subsystem which encode reward prediction errors (RPE). These neurons exhibit high activation when the reward is higher than expected and low activation when the reward is lower than expected.",

We address the problem of planning collision-free motions that minimize length under configuration-dependent Riemannian metrics, corresponding to geodesics on the configuration manifold. Conventional numerical methods for computing such paths do not scale well to high-dimensional systems, while sampling-based planners trade scalability for geometric fidelity. To bridge this gap, we propose a sampling-based motion planning framework that operates directly on Riemannian manifolds. We introduce a computationally efficient midpoint-based approximation of the Riemannian geodesic distance and prove that it matches the true Riemannian distance with third-order accuracy. Building on this approximation, we design a local planner that traces the manifold using first-order retractions guided by Riemannian natural gradients. Experiments on a two-link planar arm and a 7-DoF Franka manipulator under a kinetic-energy metric, as well as on rigid-body planning in $\\mathrm{SE}(2)$ with non-holonomic motion constraints, demonstrate that our approach consistently produces lower-cost trajectories than Euclidean-based planners and classical numerical geodesic-solver baselines.",

These challenges are particularly prominent in long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios, where autonomous vehicles must interact with heterogeneous road users, including human-driven vehicles and vulnerable road users, under complex and uncertain conditions. This paper proposes HERMES, a holistic risk-aware end-to-end multimodal driving framework designed to inject explicit long-tail risk cues into trajectory planning. HERMES employs a foundation-model-assisted annotation pipeline to produce structured Long-Tail Scene Context and Long-Tail Planning Context, capturing hazard-centric cues together with maneuver intent and safety preference, and uses these signals to guide end-to-end planning. HERMES further introduces a Tri-Modal Driving Module that fuses multi-view perception, historical motion cues, and semantic guidance, ensuring risk-aware accurate trajectory planning under long-tail scenarios. Experiments on the real-world long-tail dataset demonstrate that HERMES consistently outperforms representative end-to-end and VLM-driven baselines under long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios.

Most existing ARL methods train a single shared model parameters to support both reasoning and tool use behaviors, implicitly assuming that joint training leads to improved overall agent performance. Despite its widespread adoption, this assumption has rarely been examined empirically. In this paper, we systematically investigate this assumption by introducing a Linear Effect Attribution System(LEAS), which provides quantitative evidence of interference between reasoning and tool-use behaviors. Through an in-depth analysis, we show that these two capabilities often induce misaligned gradient directions, leading to training interference that undermines the effectiveness of joint optimization and challenges the prevailing ARL paradigm. To address this issue, we propose Disentangled Action Reasoning Tuning(DART), a simple and efficient framework that explicitly decouples parameter updates for reasoning and tool-use via separate low-rank adaptation modules. Experimental results show that DART consistently outperforms baseline methods with averaged 6.35 percent improvements and achieves performance comparable to multi-agent systems that explicitly separate tool-use and reasoning using a single model.",

Many existing methods rely on trial-and-error, testing different prompts or in-context examples until a good configuration emerges, often consuming substantial compute. Recently, natural language feedback derived from execution logs has shown promise as a way to identify how prompts can be improved. However, most prior approaches operate in a bottom-up manner, iteratively adjusting the prompt based on feedback from individual problems, which can cause them to lose the global perspective. In this work, we propose Error Taxonomy-Guided Prompt Optimization (ETGPO), a prompt optimization algorithm that adopts a top-down approach. ETGPO focuses on the global failure landscape by collecting model errors, categorizing them into a taxonomy, and augmenting the prompt with guidance targeting the most frequent failure modes. Across multiple benchmarks spanning mathematics, question answering, and logical reasoning, ETGPO achieves accuracy that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods, while requiring roughly one third of the optimization-phase token usage and evaluation budget.",

We present a formal analysis of how alignment from human feedback can increase this failure mode by identifying an explicit amplification mechanism that causally links optimization against a learned reward to bias in the human preference data used for alignment. We show that the direction of behavioral drift is determined by a covariance under the base policy between endorsing the belief signal in the prompt and the learned reward, and that the first-order effect reduces to a simple mean-gap condition. We then analyze reward learning from pairwise comparisons under random utility models like Bradley-Terry and characterize when bias in human annotators' preferences induces this reward gap. Next, we propose a training-time intervention designed to neutralize the amplification mechanism itself. Among all post-trained policies that prevent sycophantic behavior from increasing, we characterize the unique policy closest in KL divergence to the unconstrained post-trained policy, and derive the corresponding minimal reward correction as a closed-form agreement penalty. Computational experiments find that reward gaps are common and cause behavioral drift in all the configurations considered.",

In such settings, effective coordination cannot be fully designed in advance and must instead emerge through interaction. However, most prior work enforces coordination through fixed roles, workflows, or aggregation rules, leaving open the question of how well self-organizing teams perform when coordination is unconstrained. Drawing on organizational psychology, we study whether self-organizing LLM teams achieve strong synergy, where team performance matches or exceeds the best individual member. Across human-inspired and frontier ML benchmarks, we find that -- unlike human teams -- LLM teams consistently fail to match their expert agent's performance, even when explicitly told who the expert is, incurring performance losses of up to 37.6%. Decomposing this failure, we show that expert leveraging, rather than identification, is the primary bottleneck. Conversational analysis reveals a tendency toward integrative compromise -- averaging expert and non-expert views rather than appropriately weighting expertise -- which increases with team size and correlates negatively with performance. Interestingly, this consensus-seeking behavior improves robustness to adversarial agents, suggesting a trade-off between alignment and effective expertise utilization. Our findings reveal a significant gap in the ability of self-organizing multi-agent teams to harness the collective expertise of their members.",

We compare LLM-generated reasoning to human learner utterances under minimal and extended contextual prompting, and assess the models' ability to predict step-level learner success. Although GPT-4.1 generates fluent and contextually appropriate continuations, its reasoning is systematically over-coherent, verbose, and less variable than human think-alouds.

We study these questions using well-controlled synthetic experiments, training small transformers on noisy data to solve modular arithmetic expressions step by step, a task we term Arithmetic Expression Reasoning. We find that models can learn faithful reasoning that causally follows the underlying arithmetic rules, but only when the training noise is below a critical threshold, a phenomenon attributable to simplicity bias. At higher noise levels, training dynamics exhibit a transition from faithful stepwise reasoning to unfaithful skip-step reasoning via an intermediate mixed mode characterized by a transient increase in prediction entropy.

The framework commences with a two-stage, weakly supervised skill discovery process: Stage one performs coarse, task-aware macro-segmentation by employing an alignment-enforced Vector Quantized VAE guided by weak task labels. Stage two then refines these segments at a micro-level using a self-supervised sequential model, followed by an iterative clustering process to consolidate skill boundaries. The third stage then leverages these precise boundaries to construct a hierarchical policy within an option-based framework-complete with a learned termination condition beta for explicit skill switching. LOKI achieves high success rates on the challenging D4RL Kitchen benchmark and outperforms standard HIL baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the discovered skills are semantically meaningful, aligning with human intuition, and exhibit compositionality by successfully sequencing them to solve a novel, unseen task.",

        "abstract": "Recently, federated large language models (LLMs) have drawn significant attention thanks to coupled capabilities of LLMs and federated learning (FL) that address privacy concerns in collaborative fine-tuning. However, due to large-scale parameters of LLMs, existing federated LLM fine-tuning frameworks incur significant challenges in resource-constrained clients characterized by heterogeneous computing capabilities and random wireless channels. To address this issue, we propose a joint client-specific pruning and bandwidth allocation (JCPBA) framework for federated LLMs to improve the fine-tuning efficiency over the wireless networks. Specifically, we formulate a fine-tuning latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing pruning rates and bandwidth allocations. Furthermore, we solve this optimization problem using a block coordinate descent method. Extensive experiments on the datasets of Yahoo Answers and GSM8K demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces wall-clock fine-tuning time compared with state-of-the-art baselines and gains equal or lower test loss at the cost of lower computation and communication overhead.",

However, this multimodal integration expands the attack surface by exposing the model to image-based jailbreaks crafted to induce harmful responses. Existing gradient-based jailbreak methods transfer poorly, as adversarial patterns overfit to a single white-box surrogate and fail to generalise to black-box models. In this work, we propose Universal and transferable jailbreak (UltraBreak), a framework that constrains adversarial patterns through transformations and regularisation in the vision space, while relaxing textual targets through semantic-based objectives. By defining its loss in the textual embedding space of the target LLM, UltraBreak discovers universal adversarial patterns that generalise across diverse jailbreak objectives. This combination of vision-level regularisation and semantically guided textual supervision mitigates surrogate overfitting and enables strong transferability across both models and attack targets. Extensive experiments show that UltraBreak consistently outperforms prior jailbreak methods. Further analysis reveals why earlier approaches fail to transfer, highlighting that smoothing the loss landscape via semantic objectives is crucial for enabling universal and transferable jailbreaks.

However, existing mixed-precision methods typically suffer from one of two limitations: they either rely on expensive discrete optimization to determine precision allocation, or introduce hardware inefficiencies due to irregular memory layouts. We propose SFMP, a search-free and hardware-friendly mixed-precision quantization framework for large language models. The framework is built upon four novel ideas: Fractional bit-width, which extends integer bit-width for weight matrix to fractional value and transforms discrete precision allocation as a continuous problem; 2)Block-wise mixed-precision, enabling fine-grained precision within weight matrices while remaining hardware-friendly; 3)Row-column weight reordering, which aggregates salient weights via row and column reordering, incurring only a small activation reordering overhead during inference; 4)Unified GEMM kernel, which supports mixed-precision GEMM at arbitrary average bit-width. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFMP outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise mixed-precision methods under the same memory constraints, while significantly reducing quantization cost and improving inference efficiency.

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective training-free technique to address the massive memory and computation overhead. Existing quantization paradigms fall short as they are oblivious to two critical forms of heterogeneity: the inherent discrepancy between vision and language tokens, and the non-uniform contribution of different experts. To bridge this gap, we propose Visual Expert Quantization (VEQ), a dual-aware quantization framework designed to simultaneously accommodate cross-modal differences and heterogeneity between experts. Specifically, VEQ incorporates 1)Modality-expert-aware Quantization, which utilizes expert activation frequency to prioritize error minimization for pivotal experts, and 2)Modality-affinity-aware Quantization, which constructs an enhanced Hessian matrix by integrating token-expert affinity with modality information to guide the calibration process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verify that VEQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, under the W3A16 configuration, our method achieves significant average accuracy gains of 2.04\\% on Kimi-VL and 3.09\\% on Qwen3-VL compared to the previous SOTA quantization methods, demonstrating superior robustness across various multimodal tasks.

ROS2-TMS for Construction, a Cyber-Physical System framework designed to coordinate construction machinery, has been proposed for autonomous operation; however, its reliance on manually designed Behavior Trees (BTs) limits scalability, particularly in scenarios involving heterogeneous machine cooperation. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for task planning and BT generation. However, most existing approaches remain confined to simulations or simple manipulators, with relatively few applications demonstrated in real-world contexts, such as complex construction sites involving multiple machines. This paper proposes an LLM-based workflow for BT generation, introducing synchronization flags to enable safe and cooperative operation. The workflow consists of two steps: high-level planning, where the LLM generates synchronization flags, and BT generation using structured templates. Safety is ensured by planning with parameters stored in the system database. The proposed method is validated in simulation and further demonstrated through real-world experiments, highlighting its potential to advance automation in civil engineering.",

This one over time training with superposition represents an up to tenfold acceleration compared to the purely sequential learning that takes place in the absence of superposition.

To address this problem, we propose Residual Decoding (ResDec). It is a novel training-free method that uses historical information to aid decoding. The method relies on the internal implicit reasoning mechanism and token logits evolution mechanism of LVLMs to correct biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResDec effectively suppresses hallucinations induced by language priors, significantly improves visual grounding, and reduces object hallucinations.

Despite sharing base model weights, each agent independently builds and stores its own KV cache for the same long, tool-augmented trajectories, incurring substantial memory and compute overhead. Existing KV cache sharing methods largely overlook this multi-LoRA setting. We observe that, across agents, cache differences are dominated by adapter outputs, while activations from the shared pretrained backbone remain highly similar. Based on this observation, we propose LRAgent, a KV cache sharing framework for multi-LoRA agents that decomposes the cache into a shared base component from the pretrained weights and an adapter-dependent component from LoRA weights. LRAgent reduces memory overhead by sharing the base component and storing the adapter component in its inherent low-rank form, and further reduces compute overhead, enabled by shared-$A$ multi-LoRA architectures, by also sharing the low-rank cache and avoiding redundant computations for contexts already processed by other agents. To efficiently reconstruct adapter contributions at runtime, we introduce Flash-LoRA-Attention, a kernel that reorders attention computation to avoid materializing the low-rank cache to full dimension. LRAgent achieves throughput and time-to-first-token latency close to fully shared caching, while preserving accuracy near the non-shared caching baseline across agentic question-answering benchmarks.",

We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts.\nWe propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels. It can be used to augment standard SFT objectives and incurs little additional training overhead once probabilities for the offline data are collected.\nWe conduct controlled experiments on verifiable reasoning games and mathematical reasoning tasks on Qwen 2.5 and 3 and DeepSeek-distilled models. PEAR consistently improves post-RL performance over canonical SFT, with pass at 8 gains up to a 14.6 percent on AIME2025.

This raises an important question for LLM-based dialogue agents: whether such variations reflect inconsistency or context-sensitive adaptation akin to human behavior.

        "abstract": "Large behavior models have shown strong dexterous manipulation capabilities by extending imitation learning to large-scale training on multi-task robot data, yet their generalization remains limited by the insufficient robot data coverage. To expand this coverage without costly additional data collection, recent work relies on co-training: jointly learning from target robot data and heterogeneous data modalities. However, how different co-training data modalities and strategies affect policy performance remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale empirical study examining five co-training data modalities: standard vision-language data, dense language annotations for robot trajectories, cross-embodiment robot data, human videos, and discrete robot action tokens across single- and multi-phase training strategies. Our study leverages 4,000 hours of robot and human manipulation data and 50M vision-language samples to train vision-language-action policies. We evaluate 89 policies over 58,000 simulation rollouts and 2,835 real-world rollouts. Our results show that co-training with forms of vision-language and cross-embodiment robot data substantially improves generalization to distribution shifts, unseen tasks, and language following, while discrete action token variants yield no significant benefits. Combining effective modalities produces cumulative gains and enables rapid adaptation to unseen long-horizon dexterous tasks via fine-tuning. Training exclusively on robot data degrades the visiolinguistic understanding of the vision-language model backbone, while co-training with effective modalities restores these capabilities. Explicitly conditioning action generation on chain-of-thought traces learned from co-training data does not improve performance in our simulation benchmark. Together, these results provide practical guidance for building scalable generalist robot policies.",

We introduce \\cb, a scalable and mechanically verifiable benchmark for testing \\textit{whether LLMs can identify the convexity of a symbolic objective under deep functional composition.} Experiments on frontier LLMs reveal a sharp compositional reasoning gap: performance degrades rapidly with increasing depth, dropping from an F1-score of $1.0$ at depth $2$ to approximately $0.2$ at depth $100$. Inspection of models' reasoning traces indicates two failure modes: \\textit{parsing failure} and \\textit{lazy reasoning}. To address these limitations, we propose an agentic divide-and-conquer framework that (i) offloads parsing to an external tool to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) and (ii) enforces recursive reasoning over each intermediate sub-expression with focused context. This framework reliably mitigates deep-composition failures, achieving substantial performance improvement at large depths (e.g., F1-Score $= 1.0$ at depth $100$).",

While block sparse attention accelerates computation by attending only critical key-value blocks, it suffers from degradation at high sparsity by discarding context. In this work, we discover that attention scores of non-critical blocks exhibit distributional stability, allowing them to be approximated accurately and efficiently rather than discarded, which is essentially important for sparse attention design. Motivated by this key insight, we propose PISA, a training-free Piecewise Sparse Attention that covers the full attention span with sub-quadratic complexity. Unlike the conventional keep-or-drop paradigm that directly drop the non-critical block information, PISA introduces a novel exact-or-approximate strategy: it maintains exact computation for critical blocks while efficiently approximating the remainder through block-wise Taylor expansion. This design allows PISA to serve as a faithful proxy to full attention, effectively bridging the gap between speed and quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PISA achieves 1.91 times and 2.57 times speedups on Wan2.1-14B and Hunyuan-Video, respectively, while consistently maintaining the highest quality among sparse attention methods. Notably, even for image generation on FLUX, PISA achieves a 1.2 times acceleration without compromising visual quality.

In many robot-wire interaction tasks, contact occurs not at the end-effector but at other points along the robot's body. Such scenarios arise when robots manipulate wires indirectly (e.g., by nudging) or when wires act as passive obstacles in the environment. Accurately identifying these interactions is crucial for safe and efficient trajectory planning, helping to prevent wire damage, avoid restricted robot motions, and mitigate potential hazards. Existing approaches often rely on expensive external force-torque sensor or that contacts occur at the end-effector for accurate force estimation. Using wire shape information acquired from a depth camera and under the assumption that the wire is in or near its static equilibrium, our method estimates both the location and magnitude of external forces without additional prior knowledge. This is achieved by exploiting derived consistency conditions and solving a system of linear equations based on force-torque balance along the wire. The approach was validated through simulation, where it achieved high accuracy, and through real-world experiments, where accurate estimation was demonstrated in selected interaction scenarios.",

While existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on DDPM-based diffusion models and rely on costly fine-tuning, the recent emergence of flow matching models introduces a fundamentally different generative paradigm for which prior methods are not directly applicable. In this paper, we propose Differential Vector Erasure (DVE), a training-free concept erasure method specifically designed for flow matching models. Our key insight is that semantic concepts are implicitly encoded in the directional structure of the velocity field governing the generative flow. Leveraging this observation, we construct a differential vector field that characterizes the directional discrepancy between a target concept and a carefully chosen anchor concept. During inference, DVE selectively removes concept-specific components by projecting the velocity field onto the differential direction, enabling precise concept suppression without affecting irrelevant semantics. Extensive experiments on FLUX demonstrate that DVE consistently outperforms existing baselines on a wide range of concept erasure tasks, including NSFW suppression, artistic style removal, and object erasure, while preserving image quality and diversity.",

Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often entangle these processes, performing redundant multimodal reasoning at every timestep, which leads to high latency and goal instability. To address this, we present StreamVLA, a dual-system architecture that unifies textual task decomposition, visual goal imagination, and continuous action generation within a single parameter-efficient backbone. We introduce a \"Lock-and-Gated\" mechanism to intelligently modulate computation: only when a sub-task transition is detected, the model triggers slow thinking to generate a textual instruction and imagines the specific visual completion state, rather than generic future frames. Crucially, this completion state serves as a time-invariant goal anchor, making the policy robust to execution speed variations. During steady execution, these high-level intents are locked to condition a Flow Matching action head, allowing the model to bypass expensive autoregressive decoding for 72% of timesteps. This hierarchical abstraction ensures sub-goal focus while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that StreamVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 98.5% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark and robust recovery in real-world interference scenarios, achieving a 48% reduction in latency compared to full-reasoning baselines.",

In this work, we introduce a principled framework for understanding RLVR instability through the lens of objective-level hacking. Unlike reward hacking, which arises from exploitable verifiers, objective-level hacking emerges from token-level credit misalignment and is manifested as system-level spurious signals in the optimization objective. Grounded in our framework, together with extensive experiments on a 30B MoE model, we trace the origin and formalize the mechanism behind a key pathological training dynamic in MoE models: the abnormal growth of the training-inference discrepancy, a phenomenon widely associated with instability but previously lacking a mechanistic explanation.

However, these data are scarce, and collecting them for arbitrary pairs of libraries is difficult. Moreover, these migration tools often miss out on leveraging modern code transformation infrastructure.\nIn this paper, we present a new approach to automated API migration that sidesteps the limitations described above. Instead of relying on existing migration data or using LLMs directly for transformation, we use LLMs to extract migration examples. Next, we use an Agent to generalize those examples to reusable transformation scripts in PolyglotPiranha, a modern code transformation tool. Our method distills latent migration knowledge from LLMs into structured, testable, and repeatable migration logic, without requiring preexisting corpora or manual engineering effort.

Moreover, we introduce an Action Consistency Regularization (ACR), a lightweight auxiliary loss that enforces alignment between predicted action trajectories and expert demonstrations via Euler extrapolation, providing additional supervision to stabilize training and improve policy precision.

To address this, we propose a principled framework that models sequential scaling as a two-state Markov process. This approach reveals the underlying properties of sequential scaling and yields closed-form solutions for essential aspects, such as the specific conditions under which accuracy is improved and the theoretical upper, neutral, and lower performance bounds. Leveraging this formulation, we develop MarkovScale, a practical system that applies these optimality criteria to achieve a theoretically grounded balance between accuracy and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across 3 backbone LLMs, 5 benchmarks, and over 20 configurations show that MarkovScale consistently outperforms state-of-the-art parallel and sequential scaling methods, representing a significant step toward optimal and resource-efficient inference in LLMs. The source code will be open upon acceptance at https://open-upon-acceptance.",

A key challenge is that incorporating multimodal data dramatically increases sequence length, hindering the ability of attention-based models to generate coherent, long-form textual descriptions that require long-range understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that extends LLM-based TPPs to the visual modality, positioning text generation as a core capability alongside time and type prediction. Our approach addresses the long-context problem through an adaptive sequence compression mechanism based on temporal similarity, which reduces sequence length while preserving essential patterns. We employ a two-stage paradigm of pre-training on compressed sequences followed by supervised fine-tuning for downstream tasks.

Existing preference optimization methods, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), collapse feedback into a single scalar reward, fixing one balance among objectives and preventing traversal of the Pareto front. Recent work by Ortiz-Jimenez et al. (2023) showed that fine-tuning can be viewed in a model's tangent space, where linearized updates act as additive vectors that can be composed to jointly perform well on multiple tasks. Building on this formulation, we extend this idea to preference alignment and propose Tangent-Space Direct Preference Optimization (TS-DPO), which performs DPO within this locally linear regime to learn per-objective update directions. These directions can be linearly combined at inference to generate user-specified behaviors without additional optimization. Evaluated on the helpfulness-verbosity trade-off using the HelpSteer and UltraFeedback datasets, TS-DPO achieves broader Pareto-optimal coverage and smoother preference control than scalarized DPO. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) further shows that tangent-space training amplifies canonical directions aligned with distinct preferences, improving disentanglement.",

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to unify tool access, allowing agents to discover, invoke, and coordinate with tools more flexibly. However, as MCP becomes more widely adopted, it also brings a new set of security and privacy challenges. These include risks such as unauthorized access, tool poisoning, prompt injection, privilege escalation, and supply chain attacks, any of which can impact different parts of the protocol workflow. While recent research has examined possible attack surfaces and suggested targeted countermeasures, there is still a lack of systematic, protocol-level security improvements for MCP. To address this, we introduce the Secure Model Context Protocol (SMCP), which builds on MCP by adding unified identity management, robust mutual authentication, ongoing security context propagation, fine-grained policy enforcement, and comprehensive audit logging. In this paper, we present the main components of SMCP, explain how it helps reduce security risks, and illustrate its application with practical examples.

However, the efficacy of such heterogeneous networks is often compromised by the conflict between limited onboard resources and stringent stability requirements. Moving beyond traditional throughput-centric designs, we propose a Sensing-Communication-Computing-Control closed-loop framework that explicitly models the impact of communication latency on physical control stability. To guarantee mission reliability, we leverage the Lyapunov stability theory to derive an intrinsic mapping between the state evolution of the control system and communication constraints, transforming abstract stability requirements into quantifiable resource boundaries. Then, we formulate the resource allocation problem as a Stackelberg game, where UAVs (as leaders) dynamically price resources to balance load and ensure stability, while users (as followers) optimize requests based on service urgency. Furthermore, addressing the prohibitive computational overhead of standard Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on energy-constrained edge platforms, we propose a novel and lightweight pruning-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. By integrating a dynamic structured pruning mechanism, the proposed algorithm significantly compresses the neural network scale during training, enabling the UAV to rapidly approximate the game equilibrium with minimal inference latency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively secures control loop stability while maximizing system utility in dynamic low-altitude environments.",

Recent progress in large models demands that spiking neurons support highly parallel computation to scale efficiently on modern GPUs. This work proposes a novel functional perspective that provides general guidance for designing parallel spiking neurons. We argue that the reset mechanism, which induces complex temporal dependencies and hinders parallel training, should be removed. However, any such modification should satisfy two principles: 1) preserving the functions of reset as a core biological mechanism; and 2) enabling parallel training without sacrificing the serial inference ability of spiking neurons, which underpins their efficiency at test time. To this end, we identify the functions of the reset and analyze how to reconcile parallel training with serial inference, upon which we propose a dynamic decay spiking neuron. We conduct comprehensive testing of our method in terms of: 1) Training efficiency and extrapolation capability. On 16k-length sequences, we achieve a 25.6x training speedup over the pioneering parallel spiking neuron, and our models trained on 2k-length can stably perform inference on sequences as long as 30k. 2) Generality. We demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of the proposed method across five task categories (image classification, neuromorphic event processing, time-series forecasting, language modeling, and reinforcement learning), three network architectures (spiking CNN/Transformer/SSMs), and two spike activation modes (spike/integer activation). 3) Energy consumption.

We propose UniForce, a novel unified tactile representation learning framework that learns a shared latent force space across diverse tactile sensors. UniForce reduces cross-sensor domain shift by jointly modeling inverse dynamics (image-to-force) and forward dynamics (force-to-image), constrained by force equilibrium and image reconstruction losses to produce force-grounded representations. To avoid reliance on expensive external force/torque (F/T) sensors, we exploit static equilibrium and collect force-paired data via direct sensor--object--sensor interactions, enabling cross-sensor alignment with contact force. The resulting universal tactile encoder can be plugged into downstream force-aware robot manipulation tasks with zero-shot transfer, without retraining or finetuning. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tactile sensors including GelSight, TacTip, and uSkin, demonstrate consistent improvements in force estimation over prior methods, and enable effective cross-sensor coordination in Vision-Tactile-Language-Action (VTLA) models for a robotic wiping task.

Automotive manufacturers use Boolean combinations of these codes, called error patterns (EPs), to characterize system faults and ensure vehicle safety.

This paper introduces CAREP (Causal Automated Reasoning for Error Patterns), a multi-agent system that automatizes the generation of EP rules from high-dimensional event sequences of DTCs. CAREP combines a causal discovery agent that identifies potential DTC-EP relations, a contextual information agent that integrates metadata and descriptions, and an orchestrator agent that synthesizes candidate boolean rules together with interpretable reasoning traces. Evaluation on a large-scale automotive dataset with over 29,100 unique DTCs and 474 error patterns demonstrates that CAREP can automatically and accurately discover the unknown EP rules, outperforming LLM-only baselines while providing transparent causal explanations. By uniting practical causal discovery and agent-based reasoning, CAREP represents a step toward fully automated fault diagnostics, enabling scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient vehicle maintenance.",

Standard PPO relies on surrogate objectives defined via importance ratios, which require evaluating policy likelihood that is typically straightforward when the policy is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. However, extending PPO to more expressive, high-capacity policy models such as continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), also known as flow-matching models, is challenging because likelihood evaluation along the full flow trajectory is computationally expensive and often numerically unstable. To resolve this issue, we propose PolicyFlow, a novel on-policy CNF-based reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates expressive CNF policies with PPO-style objectives without requiring likelihood evaluation along the full flow path. PolicyFlow approximates importance ratios using velocity field variations along a simple interpolation path, reducing computational overhead without compromising training stability. To further prevent mode collapse and further encourage diverse behaviors, we propose the Brownian Regularizer, an implicit policy entropy regularizer inspired by Brownian motion, which is conceptually elegant and computationally lightweight. Experiments on diverse tasks across various environments including MultiGoal, PointMaze, IsaacLab and MuJoCo Playground show that PolicyFlow achieves competitive or superior performance compared to PPO using Gaussian policies and flow-based baselines including FPO and DPPO. Notably, results on MultiGoal highlight PolicyFlow's ability to capture richer multimodal action distributions.",

        "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generalist robotic manipulation, unifying perception and control within a single end-to-end architecture. However, despite their success in controlled environments, reliable real-world deployment is severely hindered by their fragility to visual disturbances. While existing literature extensively addresses physical occlusions caused by scene geometry, a critical mode remains largely unexplored: image corruptions. These sensor-level artifacts, ranging from electronic noise and dead pixels to lens contaminants, directly compromise the integrity of the visual signal prior to interpretation. In this work, we quantify this vulnerability, demonstrating that state-of-the-art VLAs such as $\\pi_{0.5}$ and SmolVLA, suffer catastrophic performance degradation, dropping from 90\\% success rates to as low as 2\\%, under common signal artifacts. To mitigate this, we introduce the Corruption Restoration Transformer (CRT), a plug-and-play and model-agnostic vision transformer designed to immunize VLA models against sensor disturbances. Leveraging an adversarial training objective, CRT restores clean observations from corrupted inputs without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning of the underlying model. Extensive experiments across the LIBERO and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that CRT effectively recovers lost performance, enabling VLAs to maintain near-baseline success rates, even under severe visual corruption.",

However, existing generative steganography methods often maintain acceptable security and robustness only at relatively low embedding rates, severely limiting the practical applicability of steganographic systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel DTAMS framework that achieves high embedding rates while ensuring strong robustness and security. Specifically, a dynamic multi-timestep adaptive embedding mechanism is constructed based on transition-cost modeling in diffusion models, enabling automatic selection of optimal embedding timesteps to improve embedding rates while preserving overall performance. Meanwhile, we propose a global sub-interval mapping strategy that jointly considers mapping errors and the frequency distribution of secret information, converting point-wise perturbations into interval-level statistical mappings to suppress error accumulation and distribution drift during multi-step diffusion processes. Furthermore, a multi-dimensional joint constraint mechanism is introduced to mitigate distortions caused by repeated latent-pixel transformations by jointly regularizing embedding errors at the pixel, latent, and semantic levels. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an embedding rate of 12 bpp while maintaining excellent security and robustness. Across all evaluated conditions, DTAMS reduces the average extraction error rate by 59.39%, representing a significant improvement over SOTA methods.",

We adopt a dataset-centric view of cultural alignment and ask which linguistic properties of fine-tuning data are associated with cultural performance, whether these properties are predictive prior to training, and how these effects vary across models. We compute lightweight linguistic, semantic, and structural metrics for Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese datasets and apply principal component analysis separately within each language. This design ensures that the resulting components capture variation among datasets written in the same language rather than differences between languages. The resulting components correspond to broadly interpretable axes related to semantic coherence, surface-level lexical and syntactic diversity, and lexical or structural richness, though their composition varies across languages. We fine-tune three major LLM families (LLaMA, Mistral, DeepSeek) and evaluate them on benchmarks of cultural knowledge, values, and norms. While PCA components correlate with downstream performance, these associations are strongly model-dependent. Through controlled subset interventions, we show that lexical-oriented components (PC3) are the most robust, yielding more consistent performance across models and benchmarks, whereas emphasizing semantic or diversity extremes (PC1-PC2) is often neutral or harmful.",

Evaluation across nine language pairs demonstrates intervention rates strongly correlating with typological distance from English.

LaRA-VLA performs unified reasoning and prediction in latent space, eliminating explicit CoT generation at inference time and enabling efficient, action-oriented control. To realize latent embodied reasoning, we introduce a curriculum-based training paradigm that progressively transitions from explicit textual and visual CoT supervision to latent reasoning, and finally adapts latent reasoning dynamics to condition action generation. We construct two structured CoT datasets and evaluate LaRA-VLA on both simulation benchmarks and long-horizon real-robot manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that LaRA-VLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLA methods while reducing inference latency by up to 90\\% compared to explicit CoT-based approaches, demonstrating latent reasoning as an effective and efficient paradigm for real-time embodied control.

Typically, in a pretrained VLM, all layers are engaged by default to make predictions on downstream tasks. We find that intervening on a single layer, such as by zeroing its parameters, can improve the performance on certain tasks, indicating that some layers hinder rather than help downstream tasks. We systematically investigate how individual layers influence different tasks via layer intervention. Specifically, we measure the change in performance relative to the base model after intervening on each layer and observe improvements when bypassing specific layers. This improvement can be generalizable across models and datasets, indicating the presence of Task-Interfering Layers that harm downstream tasks' performance. We introduce Task-Layer Interaction Vector, which quantifies the effect of intervening on each layer of a VLM given a task. These task-interfering layers exhibit task-specific sensitivity patterns: tasks requiring similar capabilities show consistent response trends under layer interventions, as evidenced by the high similarity in their task-layer interaction vectors. Inspired by these findings, we propose TaLo (Task-Adaptive Layer Knockout), a training-free, test-time adaptation method that dynamically identifies and bypasses the most interfering layer for a given task. Without parameter updates, TaLo improves performance across various models and datasets, including boosting Qwen-VL's accuracy on the Maps task in ScienceQA by up to 16.6%. Our work reveals an unexpected form of modularity in pretrained VLMs and provides a plug-and-play, training-free mechanism to unlock hidden capabilities at inference time.

We evaluate on human annotated tutor student dialogues, augmented with additional non pedagogical conversations for the binary task.

We attribute this to two primary obstacles: (1) non-stationary temporal dynamics, which can bias the inference trajectory and lead to outlier-sensitive imputations; and (2) objective inconsistency, since imputation favors accurate pointwise recovery whereas DMs are inherently trained to generate diverse samples. To better understand these issues, we analyze DM-based TSDI process through a proximal-operator perspective and uncover that an implicit Wasserstein distance regularization inherent in the process hinders the model's ability to counteract non-stationarity and dissipative regularizer, thereby amplifying diversity at the expense of fidelity. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework called SPIRIT (Semi-Proximal Transport Regularized time-series Imputation). Specifically, we introduce entropy-induced Bregman divergence to relax the mass preserving constraint in the Wasserstein distance, formulate the semi-proximal transport (SPT) discrepancy, and theoretically prove the robustness of SPT against non-stationarity. Subsequently, we remove the dissipative structure and derive the complete SPIRIT workflow, with SPT serving as the proximal operator.

The review looks at developments from early multimodal fusion methods to new frameworks that use contrastive models like CLIP, diffusion-based text-to-image generation, and large language model (LLM) support. Studies from 2016 to 2025 are examined to show the growth of VWSD through feature-based, graph-based, and contrastive embedding techniques. It focuses on prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and adapting to multiple languages. Quantitative results show that CLIP-based fine-tuned models and LLM-enhanced VWSD systems consistently perform better than zero-shot baselines, achieving gains of up to 6-8\\% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). However, challenges still exist, such as limitations in context, model bias toward common meanings, a lack of multilingual datasets, and the need for better evaluation frameworks.

First, we introduce an Efficient Multi-scale Transformer (EMFormer) to extract multi-scale features through a single convolution in both training and inference. Based on the new architecture, we further employ an accumulative context finetuning to improve temporal consistency without degrading short-term accuracy. Additionally, we propose a composite loss that dynamically balances different terms via a sinusoidal weighting, thereby adaptively guiding the optimization trajectory throughout pretraining and finetuning. Experiments show that our approach achieves strong performance in weather forecasting and extreme event prediction, substantially improving long-term forecast accuracy.

Their abilities to maintain internal memory and adapt quickly to unseen scenarios have offered them unparalleled performance when compared to non-recurrent counterparts.

In this study, by analyzing the hidden state domain of recurrent policies learned over a diverse set of training methods, model architectures, and tasks, we find that stable cyclic structures consistently emerge during interaction with the environment. Such cyclic structures share a remarkable similarity with \\textit{limit cycles} in dynamical system analysis, if we consider the policy and the environment as a joint hybrid dynamical system. Moreover, we uncover that the geometry of such limit cycles also has a structured correspondence with the policies' behaviors. These findings offer new perspectives to explain many nice properties of recurrent policies: the emergence of limit cycles stabilizes both the policies' internal memory and the task-relevant environmental states, while suppressing nuisance variability arising from environmental uncertainty; the geometry of limit cycles also encodes relational structures of behaviors, facilitating easier skill adaptation when facing non-stationary environments.",

Existing studies usually enhance the reasoning efficiency of LLMs by compressing CoT sequences. However, this approach conflicts with test-time scaling, limiting the reasoning capacity of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an efficient reasoning framework that models the reasoning process of LLMs as a state-transition process. Specifically, we first apply a linear attention mechanism to estimate the LLM's reasoning state, which records the historical reasoning information from previous reasoning steps. Then, based on the query prompt and the reasoning state, the LLM can efficiently perform the current reasoning step and update the state. With the linear attention, each token in the current reasoning step can directly retrieve relevant historical reasoning information from the reasoning state, without explicitly attending to tokens in previous reasoning steps. In this way, the computational complexity of attention is reduced from quadratic to linear, significantly improving the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. In addition, we propose a state-based reasoning strategy to mitigate the over-thinking issue caused by noisy reasoning steps. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and model sizes demonstrate that our framework not only improves the reasoning efficiency of LLMs but also enhances their reasoning performance.",

        "abstract": "The rapid evolution of agentic workflows has demonstrated strong performance of LLM-based agents in addressing complex reasoning tasks. However, existing workflow optimization methods typically formulate workflow synthesis as a static, one-shot code-centric generation problem. This paradigm imposes excessive constraints on the model's coding capabilities and restricts the flexibility required for dynamic problem-solving. In this paper, we present Workflow-R1, a framework that reformulates workflow construction as a multi-turn, natural language-based sequential decision-making process. To resolve the optimization granularity mismatch inherent in such multi-turn interactions, we introduce Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization (GSsPO). While explicitly tailored to align with the interleaved Think-Action dynamics of agentic reasoning, GSsPO fundamentally functions as a structure-aware RL algorithm generalizable to a broad class of multi-turn agentic sequential decision-making tasks. By recalibrating the optimization unit to the composite sub-sequence, specifically the atomic Think-Action cycle, it aligns gradient updates with the semantic boundaries of these interactions, ensuring robust learning in complex multi-turn reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments on multiple QA benchmarks, Workflow-R1 outperforms competitive baselines, validating GSsPO as a generalized solution for sequential reasoning and establishing Workflow-R1 as a promising new paradigm for automated workflow optimization.",

Several recent approaches aim to address this issue, including Sink Attention in GPT-OSS and Gated Attention in Qwen3-Next.

In this work, we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that the sink in Vanilla Attention and Sink Attention naturally construct a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism within attention layers. This insight explains the head collapse phenomenon observed in prior work, where only a fixed subset of attention heads contributes to generation. To mitigate head collapse, we propose a sink-aware training algorithm with an auxiliary load balancing loss designed for attention layers. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves effective head load balancing and improves model performance across Vanilla Attention, Sink Attention, and Gated Attention. We hope this study offers a new perspective on attention mechanisms and encourages further exploration of the inherent MoE structure within attention layers.",

However, scaling Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) via RL remains challenging due to interaction collapse: a pathological state where models fail to sustain multi-turn tool usage, instead degenerating into heavy internal reasoning with only trivial, post-hoc code verification. We systematically study three questions: (i) how cold-start SFT induces an agentic, tool-using behavioral prior, (ii) how the interaction density of cold-start trajectories shapes exploration and downstream RL outcomes, and (iii) how the RL interaction budget affects learning dynamics and generalization under varying inference-time budgets. We then introduce ASTER (Agentic Scaling with Tool-integrated Extended Reasoning), a framework that circumvents this collapse through a targeted cold-start strategy prioritizing interaction-dense trajectories. We find that a small expert cold-start set of just 4K interaction-dense trajectories yields the strongest downstream performance, establishing a robust prior that enables superior exploration during extended RL training. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ASTER-4B achieves state-of-the-art results on competitive mathematical benchmarks, reaching 90.0% on AIME 2025, surpassing leading frontier open-source models, including DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp.",

This thesis introduces gSMILE, a unified framework for the explainability of generative models, extending the Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations (SMILE) method to generative settings. gSMILE employs controlled perturbations of textual input, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted surrogate modelling to quantify and visualise how specific components of a prompt or instruction influence model outputs. Applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), gSMILE provides fine-grained token-level attribution and generates intuitive heatmaps that highlight influential tokens and reasoning pathways. In instruction-based image editing models, the exact text-perturbation mechanism is employed, allowing for the analysis of how modifications to an editing instruction impact the resulting image. Combined with a scenario-based evaluation strategy grounded in the Operational Design Domain (ODD) framework, gSMILE allows systematic assessment of model behaviour across diverse semantic and environmental conditions. To evaluate explanation quality, we define rigorous attribution metrics, including stability, fidelity, accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness, and apply them across multiple generative architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that gSMILE produces robust, human-aligned attributions and generalises effectively across state-of-the-art generative models. These findings highlight the potential of gSMILE to advance transparent, reliable, and responsible deployment of generative AI technologies.",

Facing these challenges, we propose SAGE (Stability-Aware Gradient Efficiency), a dynamic framework designed to enhance alignment reliability by maximizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of policy updates. Concretely, SAGE integrates a coarse-grained curriculum mechanism that refreshes candidate pools based on model competence with a fine-grained, stability-aware scoring function that prioritizes informative, confident errors while filtering out unstable samples. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAGE significantly accelerates convergence and outperforms static baselines, highlighting the critical role of policy-aware, stability-conscious data selection in reasoning alignment.",

We introduce a simple normalization strategy, termed SimpleNorm, which stabilizes intermediate activation scales by construction. Then, by analyzing the Hessian of the loss with respect to network activations, we theoretically show that SimpleNorm significantly reduces the spectral norm of the Hessian, thereby permitting larger stable learning rates. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on large GPT models at parameter scales 1B, 1.4B, 7B and 8B. Empirically, SimpleGPT, our SimpleNorm-based network, tolerates learning rates 3$\\times$-10$\\times$ larger than standard convention, consistently demonstrates strong optimization stability, and achieves substantially better performance than well-established baselines. Specifically, when training 7B-scale models for 60K steps, SimpleGPT achieves a training loss that is 0.08 lower than that of LLaMA2 with QKNorm, reducing the loss from 2.290 to 2.208.

As the context extends, the expressive capacity of such an $N$-width MLP increases, but scaling its fast weights becomes prohibitively expensive for extremely long sequences. Recently, this fast-weight scaling perspective has motivated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention, which partitions the sequence into fast-weight experts and sparsely routes the tokens to them. In this paper, we elevate this perspective to a unifying framework for a wide range of efficient attention methods by interpreting them as scaling fast weights through routing and/or compression. Then we propose a compress-and-route strategy, which compresses the $N$-width MLP into a narrower one using a small set of landmark queries and constructs deformable experts by gathering top-$k$ activated key-value pairs for each landmark query. We call this strategy a Mixture of Top-$k$ Activations (MiTA), and refer to the resulting efficient mechanism as MiTA attention. Preliminary experiments on vision tasks demonstrate the promise of our MiTA attention and motivate further investigation on its optimization and broader applications in more challenging settings.",

FutureMind introduces a dynamic reasoning pipeline composed of four key modules: Problem Analysis, Logical Reasoning, Strategy Planning, and Retrieval Guidance. This pipeline is augmented by three distinct retrieval paradigms that decompose complex queries into tractable subproblems, ensuring efficient and accurate retrieval execution. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks, including 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, Bamboogle, and Frames, demonstrate the superiority of FutureMind. It consistently outperforms strong baselines such as Search-o1, achieving state-of-the-art results under free training conditions across diverse SLM architectures and scales. Beyond empirical gains, our analysis reveals that the process of thinking-pattern distillation is restricted by the cognitive bias bottleneck between the teacher (LLMs) and student (SLMs) models. This provides new perspectives on the transferability of reasoning skills, paving the way for the development of SLMs that combine efficiency with genuine cognitive capability.",

In many settings, it is meaningful to restrict diffusion so that each node can spread information to only a limited number of its neighbors rather than to all of them. Such social networks are called closed social networks. In recent years, social media platforms have emerged as an effective medium for commercial entities, where the objective is to maximize profit. In this paper, we study the Profit Maximization in Closed Social Networks (PMCSN) problem in the context of viral marketing. The input to the problem is a closed social network and two positive integers $\\ell$ and $B$. The problem asks to select seed nodes within a given budget $B$; during the diffusion process, each node is restricted to choose at most $\\ell$ outgoing links for information diffusion; and the objective is to maximize the profit earned by the seed set. The PMCSN problem generalizes the Influence Maximization problem, which is NP-hard. We propose two solution approaches for PMCSN: a sampling-based approximate solution and a marginal-gain-based heuristic solution. We analyze the sample complexity, running time, and space requirements of the proposed approaches. We conduct experiments on real-world, publicly available social network datasets. The results show that the seed sets and diffusion links chosen by our methods yield higher profit than baseline methods.

In this paper, we propose Lotus, a method that resolves this trade-off by simply modifying the projection process. We propose a criterion that quantifies the displacement of the unit gradient to enable efficient transitions between low-rank gradient subspaces. Experimental results indicate that Lotus is the most efficient method, achieving a 30% reduction in training time and a 40% decrease in memory consumption for gradient and optimizer states.

Our greedy batch allocator dynamically distributes a fixed total token budget across queries to maximize expected accuracy. On the GSM8K arithmetic benchmark, predictive scheduling yields up to 7.9 percentage points of absolute accuracy gain over uniform budgeting at identical token cost, closing over 50\\% of the gap to an oracle with perfect foresight. A systematic layer-wise study reveals that middle layers (12 - 17) of the transformer carry the richest signals for size estimation.

However, some questions require inference, i.e., deriving answers that are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the available information. We introduce Inferential QA -- a new task that challenges models to infer answers from answer-supporting passages which provide only clues. To study this problem, we construct QUIT (QUestions requiring Inference from Texts) dataset, comprising 7,401 questions and 2.4M passages built from high-convergence human- and machine-authored hints, labeled across three relevance levels using LLM-based answerability and human verification. Through comprehensive evaluation of retrievers, rerankers, and LLM-based readers, we show that methods effective on traditional QA tasks struggle in inferential QA: retrievers underperform, rerankers offer limited gains, and fine-tuning provides inconsistent improvements. Even reasoning-oriented LLMs fail to outperform smaller general-purpose models. These findings reveal that current QA pipelines are not yet ready for inference-based reasoning. Inferential QA thus establishes a new class of QA tasks that move towards understanding and reasoning from indirect textual evidence.",

The first stage constructs discriminative prototypes from white-box models; the second generalizes to black-box sources by aligning geometric distances with observed detection scores. Experiments on EvoBench and MAGE benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple detection criteria and model families.",

Persian, spoken by roughly 130 million people, lacks a comprehensive open-domain resource for evaluating reasoning-capable QA systems. We introduce PARSE, the first open-domain Persian reasoning QA benchmark, containing 10,800 questions across Boolean, multiple-choice, and factoid formats, with diverse reasoning types, difficulty levels, and answer structures. The benchmark is built via a controlled LLM-based generation pipeline and validated through human evaluation. We also ensure linguistic and factual quality through multi-stage filtering, annotation, and consistency checks. We benchmark multilingual and Persian LLMs under multiple prompting strategies and show that Persian prompts and structured prompting (CoT for Boolean/multiple-choice; few-shot for factoid) improve performance. Fine-tuning further boosts results, especially for Persian-specialized models. These findings highlight how PARSE supports both fair comparison and practical model adaptation. PARSE fills a critical gap in Persian QA research and provides a strong foundation for developing and evaluating reasoning-capable LLMs in low-resource settings.",

        "abstract": "Requirements traceability, the process of establishing and maintaining relationships between requirements and various software development artifacts, is paramount for ensuring system integrity and fulfilling requirements throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Traditional methods, including manual and information retrieval models, are labor-intensive, error-prone, and limited by low precision. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for supporting software engineering tasks through advanced language comprehension. However, a substantial gap exists in the systematic design and evaluation of prompts tailored to extract accurate trace links. This paper introduces TraceLLM, a systematic framework for enhancing requirements traceability through prompt engineering and demonstration selection. Our approach incorporates rigorous dataset splitting, iterative prompt refinement, enrichment with contextual roles and domain knowledge, and evaluation across zero- and few-shot settings. We assess prompt generalization and robustness using eight state-of-the-art LLMs on four benchmark datasets representing diverse domains (aerospace, healthcare) and artifact types (requirements, design elements, test cases, regulations). TraceLLM achieves state-of-the-art F2 scores, outperforming traditional IR baselines, fine-tuned models, and prior LLM-based methods. We also explore the impact of demonstration selection strategies, identifying label-aware, diversity-based sampling as particularly effective. Overall, our findings highlight that traceability performance depends not only on model capacity but also critically on the quality of prompt engineering. In addition, the achieved performance suggests that TraceLLM can support semi-automated traceability workflows in which candidate links are reviewed and validated by human analysts.",

While there has been good empirical success, no theoretical analysis is available in the literature. We fill this gap by developing a rigorous sample-complexity analysis of ActiveRL through the lens of Gaussian Process (GP) uncertainty modeling. In this respect, we propose an algorithm and using GP concentration inequalities and information-gain bounds, we derive high-probability guarantees showing that an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy can be learned with ${\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ active transitions, improving upon the $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon^2(1-\\gamma)^4)$ rate of purely offline methods. Our results reveal that ActiveRL achieves near-optimal information efficiency, that is, guided uncertainty reduction leads to accelerated value-function convergence with minimal online data. Our analysis builds on GP concentration inequalities and information-gain bounds, bridging Bayesian nonparametric regression and reinforcement learning theories.

A critical barrier to resilience assessment is the scale gap between micro-level charging physics and city-scale planning: minute-resolution deliverability constraints remain invisible in hourly aggregated datasets, causing purely data-driven models to exhibit non-physical behavior in high-stress regimes. This paper develops a five-stage scientific machine learning framework bridging this gap through physics-informed knowledge transfer. Stage 1 learns a temperature-pressure deliverability surface from Swiss DC fast-charging telemetry with monotonicity constraints. Stage 2 performs cross-scale injection via anchored quantile mapping. Stage 3 deploys a dual-head spatio-temporal graph neural network for joint forecasting of demand and service loss rate. Stage 4 simulates backlog dynamics under stress shocks and evaluates policy interventions. Stage 5 couples service outcomes to distribution-grid stress via transformer loading analysis. Validation on the Shenzhen UrbanEV dataset demonstrates that physics injection restores monotone stress-to-risk response (Spearman correlation coefficient equals +1.0 versus -0.8 without injection) and improves forecasting accuracy. Under a representative demand shock, the hybrid policy reduces backlog by 79.1%, restores full service within the study horizon, and limits grid stress to only 2 additional hours. The derived resilience boundary m_crit as a function of epsilon approximately equals 1.7 minus 1.0 times epsilon, providing actionable guidance linking demand flexibility to maximum absorbable stress, enabling risk-aware emergency planning under extreme events.",

The policy receives observations comprising the robot state, the current depth frame, and a particularly local geometry representation built from a short history of depth readings. To couple collision-free motion planning with information-driven active camera control, we augment the navigation reward with a voxel-based information metric.

Building on this prior, we design a refinement network that follows the prior where reliable and deviates where necessary, enabling accurate metric predictions from very few labeled samples. The resulting system is particularly effective when curated validation data are unavailable, sustaining stable scale and sharp edges across few-shot regimes. These findings suggest that coupling foundation priors with sparse anchors is a practical route to robust, deployment-ready depth completion under real-world label scarcity.",

On Meta-World, MoW achieves a 74.5% average success rate within 300 thousand environment steps, establishing a new state of the art.

This work introduces an Agentic AI system for intent-driven autonomous networks, structured around three specialized agents. A supervisory interpreter agent, powered by language models, performs both lexical parsing of intents into executable optimization templates and cognitive refinement based on feedback, constraint feasibility, and evolving network conditions. An optimizer agent converts these templates into tractable optimization problems, analyzes trade-offs, and derives preferences across objectives. Lastly, a preference-driven controller agent, based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, leverages these preferences to operate near the Pareto frontier of network performance that best satisfies the original intent. Collectively, these agents enable networks to autonomously interpret, reason over, adapt to, and act upon diverse intents and network conditions in a scalable manner.",

While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for acceleration, existing methods in super-resolution mostly focus on U-Net architectures, whereas generic DiT quantization is typically designed for text-to-image tasks. Directly applying these methods to DiT-based super-resolution models leads to severe degradation of local textures. Therefore, we propose Q-DiT4SR, the first PTQ framework specifically tailored for DiT-based Real-ISR. We propose H-SVD, a hierarchical SVD that integrates a global low-rank branch with a local block-wise rank-1 branch under a matched parameter budget. We further propose Variance-aware Spatio-Temporal Mixed Precision: VaSMP allocates cross-layer weight bit-widths in a data-free manner based on rate-distortion theory, while VaTMP schedules intra-layer activation precision across diffusion timesteps via dynamic programming (DP) with minimal calibration. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our Q-DiT4SR achieves SOTA performance under both W4A6 and W4A4 settings. Notably, the W4A4 quantization configuration reduces model size by 5.8$\\times$ and computational operations by over 60$\\times$.

This variation suggests that using a fixed draft length limits the potential for further improvements in decoding speed. To address this challenge, we propose Pacer, a novel approach that dynamically controls draft length using a lightweight, trainable pre-verification layer. This layer pre-verifies draft tokens blockwise before they are sent to the target model, allowing the draft model to stop token generation if the blockwise pre-verification fails. We implement Pacer on multiple SD model pairs and evaluate its performance across various benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that Pacer achieves up to 2.66x Speedup over autoregressive decoding and consistently outperforms standard speculative decoding. Furthermore, when integrated with Ouroboros, Pacer attains up to 3.09x Speedup.",

These patterns persist across models and training stages, suggesting they reflect intrinsic properties of reasoning failure rather than superficial noise.

Unfortunately, their practical deployment is limited by slow inference speed, high memory usage, and the computational demands of the noise estimation process. Post-training quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution to accelerate sampling and reduce memory overhead for diffusion models. Existing PTQ methods for diffusion models typically apply uniform weights to calibration samples across timesteps, which is sub-optimal since data at different timesteps may contribute differently to the diffusion process. Additionally, due to varying activation distributions and gradients across timesteps, a uniform quantization approach is sub-optimal. Each timestep requires a different gradient direction for optimal quantization, and treating them equally can lead to conflicting gradients that degrade performance. In this paper, we propose a novel PTQ method that addresses these challenges by assigning appropriate weights to calibration samples. Specifically, our approach learns to assign optimal weights to calibration samples to align the quantized model's gradients across timesteps, facilitating the quantization process. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedrooms, and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other PTQ methods for diffusion models.",

Localization accuracy is further improved using the OLSTM DV Hop model, which integrates a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with the traditional DV Hop algorithm to estimate hop distances better and reduce multi hop errors.

However, existing benchmarks focus on logical verification of declarative propositions, often neglecting the task of explicitly synthesizing solutions. This limitation is particularly acute in applied mathematics domains, where the goal is frequently to derive concrete values or executable algorithms rather than solely proving theorems. To address this, we introduce a Lean 4 framework that enforces a construction-verification workflow, compelling the agent to define explicit solutions before proving their correctness. We curate a comprehensive benchmark AMBER (Applied Mathematics BEnchmark for Reasoning) spanning core domains of applied mathematics, including convex analysis, optimization, numerical algebra, and high-dimensional probability. Aside from theorem proving, our benchmark features complex tasks such as evaluation, algorithm design, and representation transformation. Experiments reveal that current models face significant difficulties with these constructive tasks. Notably, we observe that general-purpose reasoning models consistently outperform specialized theorem provers. We attribute this to a degradation of instruction following capabilities in specialized models. Fine-tuning on proof corpora appears to induce ``tactical overfitting\", compromising the ability to adhere to complex constructive requirements, whereas general models retain the versatility needed for multi-task formal reasoning.",

To address this task, we propose Reasoning-Enhanced Object Removal with MLLM (REORM), a reasoningenhanced object removal framework that leverages multimodal large language models to infer which elements must be jointly removed. REORM features a modular design that integrates MLLM-driven analysis, mask-guided removal, and a self-correction mechanism, along with a local-deployment variant that supports accurate editing under limited resources. To support evaluation, we introduce ICOREval, a benchmark consisting of instruction-driven removals with rich interaction dependencies.

We present StoryState, an agent-based orchestration layer that introduces an explicit and editable story state on top of training-free text-to-image generation. StoryState represents each story as a structured object composed of a character sheet, global settings, and per-page scene constraints, and employs a small set of LLM agents to maintain this state and derive 1Prompt1Story-style prompts for generation and editing. Operating purely through prompts, StoryState is model-agnostic and compatible with diverse generation backends.

Within five years, the DeFi ecosystem has lost over 15.75B USD to reported exploits. Many exploits arise from permissionless opportunities that any participant can trigger using only public state and standard interfaces, which we call Anyone-Can-Take (ACT) opportunities. Despite on-chain transparency, postmortem analysis remains slow and manual: investigations start from limited evidence, sometimes only a single transaction hash, and must reconstruct the exploit lifecycle by recovering related transactions, contract code, and state dependencies.\nWe present TxRay, a Large Language Model (LLM) agentic postmortem system that uses tool calls to reconstruct live ACT attacks from limited evidence. Starting from one or more seed transactions, TxRay recovers the exploit lifecycle, derives an evidence-backed root cause, and generates a runnable, self-contained Proof of Concept (PoC) that deterministically reproduces the incident. TxRay self-checks postmortems by encoding incident-specific semantic oracles as executable assertions.\nTo evaluate PoC correctness and quality, we develop PoCEvaluator, an independent agentic execution-and-review evaluator. On 114 incidents from DeFiHackLabs, TxRay produces an expert-aligned root cause and an executable PoC for 105 incidents, achieving 92.11% end-to-end reproduction. Under PoCEvaluator, 98.1% of TxRay PoCs avoid hard-coding attacker addresses, a +24.8pp lift over DeFiHackLabs. In a live deployment, TxRay delivers validated root causes in 40 minutes and PoCs in 59 minutes at median latency. TxRay's oracle-validated PoCs enable attack imitation, improving coverage by 15.6% and 65.5% over STING and APE.",

However, their practical utility is blocked by a critical limitation: the requirement of a fixed-length masked sequence for generation.

To address this, we propose DreamOn, a novel diffusion framework that enables dynamic, variable-length generation. DreamOn augments the diffusion process with two length control states, allowing the model to autonomously expand or contract the output length based solely on its own predictions. We integrate this mechanism into existing DLMs with minimal modifications to the training objective and no architectural changes. Built upon Dream-Coder-7B and DiffuCoder-7B, DreamOn achieves infilling performance on par with state-of-the-art autoregressive models on HumanEval-Infilling and SantaCoder-FIM and matches oracle performance achieved with ground-truth length. Our work removes a fundamental barrier to the practical deployment of DLMs, significantly advancing their flexibility and applicability for variable-length generation.

However, their prohibitively slow inference due to a large number of denoising steps limits their potential use in real-time or interactive applications. Existing acceleration methods, like distillation, truncation, or consistency training, either degrade quality, incur costly retraining, or lack generalization. We propose FlowCast, a training-free speculative generation framework that accelerates inference by exploiting the fact that FM models are trained to preserve constant velocity. FlowCast speculates future velocity by extrapolating current velocity without incurring additional time cost, and accepts it if it is within a mean-squared error threshold. This constant-velocity forecasting allows redundant steps in stable regions to be aggressively skipped while retaining precision in complex ones. FlowCast is a plug-and-play framework that integrates seamlessly with any FM model and requires no auxiliary networks. We also present a theoretical analysis and bound the worst-case deviation between speculative and full FM trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FlowCast achieves $>2.5\\times$ speedup in image generation, video generation, and editing tasks, outperforming existing baselines with no quality loss as compared to standard full generation.",

To bridge this gap, we propose A-MapReduce, a MapReduce paradigm-inspired multi-agent execution framework that recasts wide search as a horizontally structured retrieval problem. Concretely, A-MapReduce implements parallel processing of massive retrieval targets through task-adaptive decomposition and structured result aggregation. Meanwhile, it leverages experiential memory to drive the continual evolution of query-conditioned task allocation and recomposition, enabling progressive improvement in large-scale wide-search regimes. Extensive experiments on five agentic benchmarks demonstrate that A-MapReduce is (i) high-performing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on WideSearch and DeepWideSearch, and delivering 5.11% - 17.50% average Item F1 improvements compared with strong baselines with OpenAI o3 or Gemini 2.5 Pro backbones; (ii) cost-effective and efficient, delivering superior cost-performance trade-offs and reducing running time by 45.8\\% compared to representative multi-agent baselines.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive post-quantum cryptography (PQC) framework that predicts short-term mobility and channel variations and dynamically selects suitable lattice-, code-, or hash-based PQC configurations using a predictive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (APMOEA) to meet vehicular latency and security http://constraints.However, frequent cryptographic reconfiguration in dynamic vehicular environments introduces new attack surfaces during algorithm transitions. A secure monotonic-upgrade protocol prevents downgrade, replay, and desynchronization attacks during transitions.

These results demonstrate a practical path toward quantum-safe cryptography in future 6G vehicular networks. Through extensive experiments based on realistic mobility (LuST), weather (ERA5), and NR-V2X channel traces, we show that the proposed framework reduces end-to-end latency by up to 27\\%, lowers communication overhead by up to 65\\%, and effectively stabilizes cryptographic switching behavior using reinforcement learning.

To address this problem, we propose a framework that grounds model selection in the internal functional dynamics of the visual encoder. Our approach represents each task via layer wise conductance and derives a target-conditioned block importance distribution through entropy regularized alignment. Building on this, we introduce Directional Conductance Divergence (DCD), an asymmetric metric that quantifies how effectively a source task covers the target's salient functional blocks. This allows for predicting target model rankings by aggregating source task ranks without direct inference.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely used to ground Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-hop question answering. Recent work mainly focused on improving answer accuracy via fine-tuning and structured or reinforcement-based optimization. However, reliable reasoning in response generation faces three challenges: 1) Reasoning Collapse. Reasoning in multi-hop QA is inherently complex due to multi-hop composition and is further destabilized by noisy retrieval. 2) Reasoning-answer inconsistency. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty of LLM generation and exposure to evidence--distractor mixtures, models may produce correct answers that are not faithfully supported by their intermediate reasoning or evidence. 3) Loss of format control. Traditional chain-of-thought generation often deviates from required structured output formats, leading to incomplete or malformed structured content. To address these challenges, we propose CRAFT (Calibrated Reasoning with Answer-Faithful Traces), a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning framework that trains models to perform faithful reasoning during response generation. CRAFT employs dual reward mechanisms to optimize multi-hop reasoning: deterministic rewards ensure structural correctness while judge-based rewards verify semantic faithfulness. This optimization framework supports controllable trace variants that enable systematic analysis of how structure and scale affect reasoning performance and faithfulness. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks show that CRAFT improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness across model scales, with the CRAFT 7B model achieving competitive performance with closed-source LLMs across multiple reasoning trace settings.",

This problem has a direct impact on viral marketing in social networks. Over the past decade, several traditional methodologies (i.e., non-learning-based, which include approximate solution, heuristic solution, etc.) have been developed, and many of them produce promising results. All these methods require the information diffusion model as input. However, it may not be realistic to consider any particular diffusion model as real-world diffusion scenarios will be much more complex and need not follow the rules for any particular diffusion model. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework to solve the profit maximization problem. Our model makes a latent representation of the seed sets and is able to learn the diversified information diffusion pattern. We also design a noble objective function that can be optimized effectively using the proposed learning-based approach. The proposed model has been evaluated with the real-world datasets, and the results are reported. We compare the effectiveness of the proposed approach with many existing methods and observe that the seed set chosen by the proposed learning-based approach leads to more profit compared to existing methods.

Though existing models have achieved significant fidelity, they still suffer from two core limitations: (i) They treat motion periodicity and keyframe saliency as independent factors, overlooking their coupling and causing generation drift in long sequences. (ii) They are fragile to semantically equivalent paraphrases, where minor synonym substitutions distort textual embeddings, propagating through the decoder and producing unstable or erroneous motions. In this work, we propose T2M Mamba to address these limitations by (i) proposing Periodicity-Saliency Aware Mamba, which utilizes novel algorithms for keyframe weight estimation via enhanced Density Peaks Clustering and motion periodicity estimation via FFT-accelerated autocorrelation to capture coupled dynamics with minimal computational overhead, and (ii) constructing a Periodic Differential Cross-modal Alignment Module (PDCAM) to enhance robust alignment of textual and motion embeddings. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets have been conducted, confirming the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an FID of 0.068 and consistent gains on all other metrics.",

To address this, we propose XDLM, which bridges the two paradigms via a stationary noise kernel. XDLM offers two key contributions: (1) it provides a principled theoretical unification of MDLM and UDLM, recovering each paradigm as a special case; and (2) an alleviated memory bottleneck enabled by an algebraic simplification of the posterior probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that XDLM advances the Pareto frontier between understanding capability and generation quality. Quantitatively, XDLM surpasses UDLM by 5.4 points on zero-shot text benchmarks and outperforms MDLM in few-step image generation (FID 54.1 vs. 80.8). When scaled to tune an 8B-parameter large language model, XDLM achieves 15.0 MBPP in just 32 steps, effectively doubling the baseline performance. Finally, analysis of training dynamics reveals XDLM's superior potential for long-term scaling. Code is available at https://github.com/MzeroMiko/XDLM",

To fill this gap, we propose Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (TLGA) to thoroughly investigate component-level vulnerabilities in video MoE models. We first design attacks on the router, revealing its independent weaknesses. Building on this, we introduce Joint Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (J-TLGA), which collaboratively perturb both routers and experts. This joint attack significantly amplifies adversarial effects and exposes the Achilles' Heel (collaborative weaknesses) of the MoE architecture. Based on these insights, we further propose Joint Temporal Lipschitz Adversarial Training (J-TLAT). J-TLAT performs joint training to further defend against collaborative weaknesses, enhancing component-wise robustness. Our framework is plug-and-play and reduces inference cost by more than 60% compared with dense models. It consistently enhances adversarial robustness across diverse datasets and architectures, effectively mitigating both the independent and collaborative weaknesses of MoE.",

A central component in this process is the reward model, which evaluates partial solutions and guides the allocation of computation during inference.\nHowever, in practice, true reward models are never available. All deployed systems rely on approximate reward models, raising a fundamental question: Why and when do approximate reward models suffice for effective inference-time scaling? In this work, we provide a theoretical answer. We identify the Bellman error of the approximate reward model as the key quantity governing the effectiveness of SMC-based inference-time scaling. For a reasoning process of length $T$, we show that if the Bellman error of the approximate reward model is bounded by $O(1/T)$, then combining this reward model with SMC reduces the computational complexity of reasoning from exponential in $T$ to polynomial in $T$.

We present PromptRL (Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation), a framework that incorporates language models (LMs) as trainable prompt refinement agents directly within the flow-based RL optimization loop. This design yields two complementary benefits: rapid development of sophisticated prompt rewriting capabilities and, critically, a synergistic training regime that reshapes the optimization dynamics. PromptRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, obtaining scores of 0.97 on GenEval, 0.98 on OCR accuracy, and 24.05 on PickScore.\nFurthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our RL approach on large-scale image editing models, improving the EditReward of FLUX.1-Kontext from 1.19 to 1.43 with only 0.06 million rollouts, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as Nano Banana), which scores 1.37, and achieving comparable performance with ReasonNet (1.44), which relied on fine-grained data annotations along with a complex multi-stage training.

To address inefficiency of ground-support motion (moving on land/seabed) for quadcopter based designs, we introduce an eccentric Center of Gravity (CoG) design that inherently aligns thrust with motion, enhancing efficiency without specialized mechanical transformation designs. Furthermore, to address the drastic differences in motion control caused by different fluids (air and water), we develop a unified propulsion system based on Field-Oriented Control (FOC). This method resolves torque matching issues and enables precise, rapid bidirectional thrust across different mediums. Grounded in the perspective of living condition and ground support, we analyse the robot's dynamics and propose a Hybrid Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HNMPC)-PID control system to ensure stable multi-domain motion and seamless transitions.

In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for portfolio optimization that incorporates Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) into several DRL algorithms. The approach replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in both actor and critic components-utilizing learnable B-spline univariate functions to achieve parameter-efficient and more interpretable function approximation. During actor updates, we introduce a physics-informed regularization loss that promotes second-order temporal consistency between observed return dynamics and the action-induced portfolio adjustments. The proposed framework is evaluated across three equity markets-China, Vietnam, and the United States, covering both emerging and developed economies. Across all three markets, PIKAN-based agents consistently deliver higher cumulative and annualized returns, superior Sharpe and Calmar ratios, and more favorable drawdown characteristics compared to both standard DRL baselines and classical online portfolio-selection methods. This yields more stable training, higher Sharpe ratios, and superior performance compared to traditional DRL counterparts.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by adapting the network to the robot's target environment without external supervision, leveraging the large amounts of data a robot might naturally collect during long-term operation. In such settings, UDA methods can exploit multi-view consistency across the environment's map to fine-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion and mitigate domain shift. However, these approaches remain sensitive to cross-view instance-level inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a method that starts from a volumetric 3D map to generate multi-view consistent pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels using the zero-shot instance segmentation capabilities of a foundation model, enforcing instance-level coherence. The refined annotations serve as supervision for self-supervised fine-tuning, enabling the robot to adapt its perception system at deployment time. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance over state-of-the-art UDA baselines based on multi-view consistency, without requiring any ground-truth labels in the target domain.",

        "abstract": "Digital video is central to communication, education, and entertainment, but without audio description (AD), blind and low-vision audiences are excluded. While crowdsourced platforms and vision-language-models (VLMs) expand AD production, quality is rarely checked systematically. Existing evaluations rely on NLP metrics and short-clip guidelines, leaving questions about what constitutes quality for full-length content and how to assess it at scale. To address these questions, we first developed a multi-dimensional assessment framework for uninterrupted, full-length video, grounded in professional guidelines and refined by accessibility specialists. Second, we integrated this framework into a comprehensive methodological workflow, utilizing Item Response Theory, to assess the proficiency of VLM and human raters against expert-established ground truth. Findings suggest that while VLMs can approximate ground-truth ratings with high alignment, their reasoning was found to be less reliable and actionable than that of human respondents. These insights show the potential of hybrid evaluation systems that leverage VLMs alongside human oversight, offering a path towards scalable AD quality control.",

However, it remains unclear which importance signals, selection policies, and their interplay are most effective. In this work, we revisit where and how to distill in autoregressive LLMs. We disentangle selective KD along the position, class, and sample axes and systematically compare importance signals and selection policies. Then, guided by this analysis, we identify underexplored opportunities and introduce student-entropy-guided position selection (SE-KD). Across a suite of benchmarks, SE-KD often improves accuracy, downstream task adherence, and memory efficiency over dense distillation. Extending this approach across the class and sample axes (SE-KD 3X) yields complementary efficiency gains that make offline teacher caching feasible. In practice, this reduces wall time by 70% and peak memory by 18%, while cutting storage usage by 80% over prior methods without sacrificing performance.",

To understand and overcome the challenges preventing users from giving high-quality feedback, we conducted two studies examining feedback dynamics between humans and conversational agents (CAs). Our formative study, through the lens of Grice's maxims, identified four Feedback Barriers -- Common Ground, Verifiability, Communication, and Informativeness -- that prevent high-quality feedback by users. Building on these findings, we derive three design desiderata and show that systems incorporating scaffolds aligned with these desiderata enabled users to provide higher-quality feedback.

Current mixed-precision training approaches either apply uniform precision to all GEMM operations or rely on heuristic-based methods that fail to generalize during training, leading to suboptimal convergence and instability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SNIP, a fine-grained adaptive mixed-precision training framework for LLM pretraining that supports subbyte precision. SNIP periodically collects statistics on activations, gradients, and optimizer states to assess the precision loss impact on model quality. We define two key metrics: loss divergence in the forward pass, caused by quantization-induced increases in training loss, and weight divergence in the backward pass, which measures error propagation through gradients affecting model updates. These metrics guide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that systematically optimizes layerwise precision to minimize overall quality loss while meeting efficiency targets. Experiments on 1B, 3B, 7B and 70B Llama-like models demonstrate that SNIP consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing FLOPs by up to 80% while preserving model quality across different model sizes and training phases with minimal computational overhead.",

Naively scaling value functions -- including with a transformer architecture, which is known to be highly scalable -- often results in learning instability and worse performance. In this work, we ask what prevents transformers from scaling effectively for value functions? Through empirical analysis, we identify the critical failure mode in this scaling: attention scores collapse as capacity increases. Our key insight is that we can effectively prevent this collapse and stabilize training by controlling the entropy of the attention scores, thereby enabling the use of larger models. To this end, we propose Transformer Q-Learning (TQL), a method that unlocks the scaling potential of transformers in learning value functions in RL. Our approach yields up to a 43% improvement in performance when scaling from the smallest to the largest network sizes, while prior methods suffer from performance degradation.",

This paper tackles this challenge as a semantic identification task from the road scenes captured by a vehicle's front-view camera. Specifically, the collocation of gaze points with object semantics is investigated using three distinct vision-based approaches: direct object detection (YOLOv13), segmentation-assisted classification (SAM2 paired with EfficientNetV2 versus YOLOv13), and query-based Vision-Language Models, VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL-7b versus Qwen2.5-VL-32b). The results demonstrate that the direct object detection (YOLOv13) and Qwen2.5-VL-32b significantly outperform other approaches, achieving Macro F1-Scores over 0.84. The large VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32b), in particular, exhibited superior robustness and performance for identifying small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights, especially in adverse nighttime conditions. Conversely, the segmentation-assisted paradigm suffers from a \"part-versus-whole\" semantic gap that led to large failure in recall. The results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the real-time efficiency of traditional detectors and the richer contextual understanding and robustness offered by large VLMs. These findings provide critical insights and practical guidance for the design of future human-aware intelligent driver monitoring systems.",

Quantization reduces memory and inference costs at the risk of performance loss. Strides have been made to mitigate low precision issues mainly by understanding in-distribution (ID) task behaviour, but the attention mechanism may provide insight on quantization attributes by exploring out-of-distribution (OOD) situations. We investigate the behaviour of quantized small-variant popular vision transformers (DeiT, DeiT3, and ViT) on common OOD datasets. ID analyses show the initial instabilities of 4-bit models, particularly of those trained on the larger ImageNet-22k, as the strongest FP32 model, DeiT3, sharply drop 17% from quantization error to be one of the weakest 4-bit models. While ViT shows reasonable quantization robustness for ID calibration, OOD detection reveals more: ViT and DeiT3 pretrained on ImageNet-22k respectively experienced a 15.0% and 19.2% average quantization delta in AUPR-out between full precision to 4-bit while their ImageNet-1k-only counterparts experienced a 9.5% and 12.0% delta.

Importantly, the system was designed for real production use and was not tuned for SWE-bench. When evaluated post hoc on SWE-bench 500, it resolves 72.4% of tasks, outperforming single-agent baselines using comparable language models. Our results suggest that replicating team structure, methodology, and communication is a powerful paradigm for autonomous software engineering, and that future progress may depend as much on organizational design and agent infrastructure as on model improvements.",

        "abstract": "Self-attention has greatly contributed to the success of the widely used Transformer architecture by enabling learning from data with long-range dependencies. In an effort to improve performance, a gated attention model that leverages a gating mechanism within the multi-head self-attention has recently been proposed as a promising alternative. Gated attention has been empirically demonstrated to increase the expressiveness of low-rank mapping in standard attention and even to eliminate the attention sink phenomenon. Despite its efficacy, a clear theoretical understanding of gated attention's benefits remains lacking in the literature. To close this gap, we rigorously show that each entry in a gated attention matrix or a multi-head self-attention matrix can be written as a hierarchical mixture of experts. By recasting learning as an expert estimation problem, we demonstrate that gated attention is more sample-efficient than multi-head self-attention. In particular, while the former needs only a polynomial number of data points to estimate an expert, the latter requires exponentially many data points to achieve the same estimation error. Furthermore, our analysis also provides a theoretical justification for why gated attention yields higher performance when a gate is placed at the output of the scaled dot product attention or the value map rather than at other positions in the multi-head self-attention architecture.",

We identify a reproducible inference-time phenomenon, termed Self-Compression: when multiple independent and answerable questions are presented within a single prompt, the model spontaneously produces shorter reasoning traces for each question. This phenomenon arises from multi-question contextual pressure during generation and consistently manifests across models and benchmarks. Building on this observation, we propose ConPress (Learning from Contextual Pressure), a lightweight self-supervised fine-tuning approach. ConPress constructs multi-question prompts to induce self-compression, samples the resulting model outputs, and parses and filters per-question traces to obtain concise yet correct reasoning trajectories. These trajectories are directly used for supervised fine-tuning, internalizing compressed reasoning behavior in single-question settings without external teachers, manual pruning, or reinforcement learning. With only 8k fine-tuning examples, ConPress reduces reasoning token usage by 59% on MATH500 and 33% on AIME25, while maintaining competitive accuracy.",

Though the straight-forward ''best-of-$N$'' (BoN) strategy has already demonstrated significant improvements in performance, it lacks principled guidance on the choice of $N$, budget allocation, and multi-stage decision-making, thereby leaving substantial room for optimization. While many works have explored such optimization, rigorous theoretical guarantees remain limited. In this work, we propose new methodologies to predict and improve scaling properties via tail-guided search. By estimating the tail distribution of rewards, our method predicts the scaling law of LLMs without the need for exhaustive evaluations. Leveraging this prediction tool, we introduce Scaling-Law Guided (SLG) Search, a new test-time algorithm that dynamically allocates compute to identify and exploit intermediate states with the highest predicted potential. We theoretically prove that SLG achieves vanishing regret compared to perfect-information oracles, and achieves expected rewards that would otherwise require a polynomially larger compute budget required when using BoN. Empirically, we validate our framework across different LLMs and reward models, confirming that tail-guided allocation consistently achieves higher reward yields than Best-of-$N$ under identical compute budgets.

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, symbolic reasoning, and tool use, but reliably solving PDEs across heterogeneous settings remains challenging. Prior work on LLM-based code generation and transformer-based foundation models for PDE learning has shown promising advances. However, a persistent trade-off between execution success rate and numerical accuracy arises, particularly when generalization to unseen parameters and boundary conditions is required. In this work, we propose OpInf-LLM, an LLM parametric PDE solving framework based on operator inference. The proposed framework leverages a small amount of solution data to enable accurate prediction of diverse PDE instances, including unseen parameters and configurations, and provides seamless integration with LLMs for natural language specification of PDE solving tasks. Its low computational demands and unified tool interface further enable a high execution success rate across heterogeneous settings. By combining operator inference with LLM capabilities, OpInf-LLM opens new possibilities for generalizable reduced-order modeling in LLM-based PDE solving.",

In computations, however, the geometric volume enclosed by the interface -- the region where the order parameter $\\phi$ is positive -- may drift at finite interface thickness, producing artificial shrinkage or growth even when the sharp-interface limit conserves volume. We revisit and extend the improved-conservation framework of Zhou et al., where one replaces classical mass conservation by the exact conservation of a designed monotone mapping $Q(\\phi)$ that more accurately approximates a step function. Building on this framework, we (i) carry out the matched-asymptotic analysis in the unscaled physical time formulation, (ii) derive a simplified representation of the first-order inner correction to the interface profile, and (iii) identify an integral-moment cancellation condition that controls the leading geometric-volume defect. This mechanism becomes a practical design rule: we select regularization kernels within parameterized families -- including exponential and Pade-type -- to reach effective higher-order behavior and satisfy the cancellation condition at moderate parameter values. As a result, the proposed kernels achieve formal third-order accuracy in geometric-volume conservation with respect to interface thickness. Finally, we describe an unconditional energy-dissipative numerical discretization that exactly preserves the discrete conserved quantity. Numerical benchmarks on multi-scale droplet coarsening and shape relaxation demonstrate that the moment-balanced kernels virtually eliminate artificial drift and prevent premature extinction of small droplets.",

To address these challenges, we propose TreeLoc, a LiDAR-based global localization framework for forests that handles place recognition and 6-DoF pose estimation. We represent scenes using tree stems and their Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), which are aligned to a common reference frame via their axes and summarized using the tree distribution histogram (TDH) for coarse matching, followed by fine matching with a 2D triangle descriptor. Finally, pose estimation is achieved through a two-step geometric verification. On diverse forest benchmarks, TreeLoc outperforms baselines, achieving precise localization. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. We also propose applications for long-term forest management using descriptors from a compact global tree database.

In this work, we propose Qrita, an efficient Top-k and Top-p algorithm based on a pivot-based selection strategy. Based on RTop-k, which uses a pivot-based search for node selection in graph neural networks, Qrita extends the concept of pivot-based search to both Top-k and Top-p with two key techniques: 1. Gaussian-based sigma-truncation, which greatly reduces the search space of the target elements, and 2. Quaternary pivot search with duplication handling, which halves the pivot search iteration and guarantees deterministic output. We provide the full implementation of Qrita using Triton, a popular GPU programming language. Our evaluation of Qrita against the Top-k and Top-p kernels of high performance LLM execution engines such as vLLM, SGLang, and Flashinfer show that Qrita achieves up to 2 times throughput and half memory use while providing the same output to the the sorting-based algorithms.",

Concretely, pretrained vision and text features form mismatched anisotropic regions, yielding a dominant \"gap\" direction that acts like a translation component and disproportionately steers early gradients under rank-1 constraints. Analyzing pretrained representations, we identify a modality-gap axis that dominates early gradient flow, while a random rank-1 initialization is unlikely to align with it, leading to weak gradients and training collapse. We propose Gap-Init, a geometry-aware initialization that aligns the rank-1 LoRA direction with an estimated modality-gap vector from a small calibration set, while keeping the initial LoRA update zero. Across multiple vision-language tasks and backbones, Gap-Init consistently stabilizes rank-1 training and can match or outperform strong rank-8 baselines. Our results suggest that at the extreme low-rank limit, initial alignment can matter as much as rank itself.",

We show that $\\xi$ determines sample efficiency by controlling reward variance and the likelihood of informative trajectories. Our analysis reveals three regimes: in the \\emph{deficient} regime ($\\xi \\to 0$), informative trajectories are rare and the sample complexity explodes; in the \\emph{balanced} regime ($\\xi=\\Theta(1)$), informative trajectories occur with non-negligible probability and RL is maximally sample-efficient; and in the \\emph{ample} regime ($\\xi \\to \\infty$), learning remains stable but marginal gains per iteration diminish. We further provide finite-sample guarantees for online RL that characterize learning progress across these regimes.

Yet vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly consume chart images in automated analysis pipelines, and a growing body of benchmark evidence indicates that this human-centered knowledge base does not straightforwardly transfer to machine audiences. Machines exhibit different encoding performance patterns, process images through patch-based tokenization rather than holistic perception, and fail on design patterns that pose no difficulty for humans-while occasionally succeeding where humans struggle. Current approaches address this gap primarily by bypassing vision entirely, converting charts to data tables or structured text. We argue that this response forecloses a more fundamental question: what visual representations would actually serve machine cognition well? This paper makes the case that the visualization field needs to investigate machine-oriented visual design as a distinct research problem. We synthesize evidence from VLM benchmarks, visual reasoning research, and visualization literacy studies to show that the human-machine perceptual divergence is qualitative, not merely quantitative, and critically examine the prevailing bypassing approach. We propose a conceptual distinction between human-oriented and machine-oriented visualization-not as an engineering architecture but as a recognition that different audiences may require fundamentally different design foundations-and outline a research agenda for developing the empirical foundations the field currently lacks: the beginnings of a \"machine Bertin\" to complement the human-centered knowledge the field already possesses.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated judges, yet they remain susceptible to cognitive biases -- often altering their reasoning when faced with spurious prompt-level cues such as consensus claims or authority appeals. Existing mitigations via prompting or supervised fine-tuning fail to generalize, as they modify surface behavior without changing the optimization objective that makes bias cues predictive. To address this gap, we propose Epistemic Independence Training (EIT), a reinforcement learning framework grounded in a key principle: to learn independence, bias cues must be made non-predictive of reward. EIT operationalizes this through a balanced conflict strategy where bias signals are equally likely to support correct and incorrect answers, combined with a reward design that penalizes bias-following without rewarding bias agreement. Experiments on Qwen3-4B demonstrate that EIT improves both accuracy and robustness under adversarial biases, while preserving performance when bias aligns with truth. Notably, models trained only on bandwagon bias generalize to unseen bias types such as authority and distraction, indicating that EIT induces transferable epistemic independence rather than bias-specific heuristics.

        "abstract": "Logit Lens has been proposed for visualizing tokens that contribute most to LLM answers. Recently, Logit Lens was also shown to be applicable in autoregressive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where it illustrates the conceptual content of image tokens in the form of heatmaps, e.g., which image tokens are likely to depict the concept of cat in a given image. However, the visual content of image tokens often gets diffused to language tokens, and consequently, the locality of visual information gets mostly destroyed, which renders Logit Lens visualization unusable for explainability. To address this issue, we introduce a complementary loss to next-token prediction (NTP) to prevent the visual tokens from losing the visual representation inherited from corresponding image patches. The proposed Logit Lens Loss (LLL) is designed to make visual token embeddings more semantically aligned with the textual concepts that describe their image regions (e.g., patches containing a cat with the word \"cat\"), without requiring any architectural modification or large-scale training. This way, LLL constrains the mixing of image and text tokens in the self-attention layers in order to prevent image tokens from losing their localized visual information. As our experiments show, LLL not only makes Logit Lens practically relevant by producing meaningful object confidence maps in images, but also improves performance on vision-centric tasks like segmentation without attaching any special heads.",

However, in practical applications, rotational deformations can disrupt the spatial layout of strokes, substantially reducing recognition accuracy. Extracting rotation-invariant features therefore remains a challenging open problem. In this work, we employ the Sliding Window Path Signature (SW-PS) to capture local structural features of characters, and introduce the lightweight Linear Recurrent Units (LRU) as the classifier. The LRU combine the fast incremental processing capability of recurrent neural networks (RNN) with the efficient parallel training of state space models (SSM), while reliably modelling dynamic stroke characteristics. We conducted recognition experiments with random rotation angle up to $\\pm 180^{\\circ}$ on three subsets of the CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 dataset: digits, English upper letters, and Chinese radicals. The accuracies achieved after ensemble learning were $99.62\\%$, $96.67\\%$, and $94.33\\%$, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SW-PS+LRU framework consistently surpasses competing models in both convergence speed and test accuracy.",

Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars.

However, despite the impressive progress achieved by CNN- and Transformer-based models, their performance often deteriorates when applied across diverse environments due to severe domain discrepancies. Direct joint training on multiple datasets, which intuitively should enhance generalization, instead results in negative transfer, as shared and domain-specific representations become entangled. To address this challenge, we propose the Feature Separation and Cross-Attention Network FSCA-Net, a unified framework that explicitly disentangles feature representations into domain-invariant and domain-specific components. A novel cross-attention fusion module adaptively models interactions between these components, ensuring effective knowledge transfer while preserving dataset-specific discriminability. Furthermore, a mutual information optimization objective is introduced to maximize consistency among domain-invariant features and minimize redundancy among domain-specific ones, promoting complementary shared-private representations. Extensive experiments on multiple crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that FSCA-Net effectively mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset generalization, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-world crowd analysis.",

Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding. We will open-source the CogSense-Bench and our model weights.",

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features. Our results challenge the prevailing reliance on complex engineering techniques, demonstrating that simple design choices are potentially sufficient to achieve the same capabilities.",

However, existing shared-token designs are mostly architecture-driven and lack an explicit criterion for what information tokens should preserve to support both understanding and generation. Therefore, we introduce a capacity-constrained perspective, highlighting that in shared-token unified MLLMs the visual tokenizer behaves as a compute-bounded learner, so the token budget should prioritize reusable structure over hard-to-exploit high-entropy variations and redundancy. Motivated by this perspective, we propose InfoTok, an information-regularized visual tokenization mechanism grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. InfoTok formulates tokenization as controlling information flow from images to shared tokens to multimodal outputs, yielding a principled trade-off between compression and task relevance via mutual-information regularization. We integrate InfoTok into three representative unified MLLMs without introducing any additional training data. Experiments show consistent improvements on both understanding and generation, supporting information-regularized tokenization as a principled foundation for learning a shared token space in unified MLLMs.",

In this paper, we propose a human-simulation-based framework that enables AI systems to autonomously form questions and set tasks by reasoning over their internal states, environmental observations, and interactions with other AI systems. The proposed method treats question formation as a first-class decision process preceding task selection and execution, and integrates internal-driven, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware prompting scopes to progressively expand cognitive coverage. In addition, the framework supports learning the question-formation process from experience, allowing the system to improve its adaptability and decision quality over time. xperimental results in a multi-agent simulation environment show that environment-aware prompting significantly reduces no-eat events compared with the internal-driven baseline, and inter-agent-aware prompting further reduces cumulative no-eat events by more than 60% over a 20-day simulation, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05).",

To support systematic analysis, we introduce the Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) Benchmark, a large-scale dataset comprising 3,776 decision-making scenarios across nine social domains, designed to quantify implicit bias in long-term decision processes. Using a realistic long-horizon simulation framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs integrated with three representative memory architectures on DIB and demonstrate that LLMs' implicit bias does not remain static but intensifies over time and propagates across unrelated domains. We further analyze mitigation strategies and show that a static system-level prompting baseline provides limited and short-lived debiasing effects. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT), an agentic intervention that enforces fairness constraints at memory write time.

AROA defines originality as rarity within a reference corpus and evaluates it through four complementary components: structural rarity, claim rarity, evidence rarity, and cognitive depth. The framework quantifies the rarity of each component using density estimation and integrates them with a quality adjustment mechanism, thereby treating quality and originality as independent evaluation axes. Experiments using human essays and AI-generated essays revealed a strong negative correlation between quality and claim rarity, demonstrating a quality-originality trade-off where higher-quality texts tend to rely on typical claim patterns. Furthermore, while AI essays achieved comparable levels of structural complexity to human essays, their claim rarity was substantially lower than that of humans, indicating that LLMs can reproduce the form of argumentation but have limitations in the originality of content.",

We study N-robot forest-structured mixed-hierarchy games, in which each robot acts as a Stackelberg leader over its subtree while robots in different branches interact via Nash equilibria. We derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) first-order optimality conditions for this class of games and show that they involve increasingly high-order derivatives of robots' best-response policies as the hierarchy depth grows, rendering a direct solution intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a quasi-policy approximation that removes higher-order policy derivatives and develop an inexact Newton method for efficiently solving the resulting approximated KKT systems. We prove local exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm for games with non-quadratic objectives and nonlinear constraints.

        "abstract": "Sentence representations are foundational to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. While recent methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive sentence representations, most rely on final-layer hidden states, which are optimized for next-token prediction and thus often fail to capture global, sentence-level semantics. This paper introduces a novel perspective, demonstrating that attention value vectors capture sentence semantics more effectively than hidden states. We propose Value Aggregation (VA), a simple method that pools token values across multiple layers and token indices. In a training-free setting, VA outperforms other LLM-based embeddings, even matches or surpasses the ensemble-based MetaEOL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when paired with suitable prompts, the layer attention outputs can be interpreted as aligned weighted value vectors. Specifically, the attention scores of the last token function as the weights, while the output projection matrix ($W_O$) aligns these weighted value vectors with the common space of the LLM residual stream. This refined method, termed Aligned Weighted VA (AlignedWVA), achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free LLM-based embeddings, outperforming the high-cost MetaEOL by a substantial margin. Finally, we highlight the potential of obtaining strong LLM embedding models through fine-tuning Value Aggregation.",

Prior targeted transfer attacks often overfit surrogate-specific embedding space by relying on a single reference and emphasizing final-layer alignment, which underutilizes intermediate semantics and degrades transfer across heterogeneous VLMs. To address this, we propose SGHA-Attack, a Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Alignment framework that adopts multiple target references and enforces intermediate-layer consistency. Concretely, we generate a visually grounded reference pool by sampling a frozen text-to-image model conditioned on the target prompt, and then carefully select the Top-K most semantically relevant anchors under the surrogate to form a weighted mixture for stable optimization guidance. Building on these anchors, SGHA-Attack injects target semantics throughout the feature hierarchy by aligning intermediate visual representations at both global and spatial granularities across multiple depths, and by synchronizing intermediate visual and textual features in a shared latent subspace to provide early cross-modal supervision before the final projection. Extensive experiments on open-source and commercial black-box VLMs show that SGHA-Attack achieves stronger targeted transferability than prior methods and remains robust under preprocessing and purification defenses.",

However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.",

In this work, we identify a simple intuition specific to preference learning that calls into question the suitability of these existing design objectives. Motivated by this insight, we propose two active learning algorithms.

However, instead of explicitly performing temporal interaction through self-attention, linear models implicitly perform it based on stacked MLP structures, which may be insufficient in capturing the complex temporal dependencies and their performance still has potential for improvement. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Sparse Interaction Network (LSINet) for TSF task. Inspired by the sparsity of self-attention, we propose a Multihead Sparse Interaction Mechanism (MSIM). Different from self-attention, MSIM learns the important connections between time steps through sparsity-induced Bernoulli distribution to capture temporal dependencies for TSF. The sparsity is ensured by the proposed self-adaptive regularization loss. Moreover, we observe the shareability of temporal interactions and propose to perform Shared Interaction Learning (SIL) for MSIM to further enhance efficiency and improve convergence. LSINet is a linear model comprising only MLP structures with low overhead and equipped with explicit temporal interaction mechanisms. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that LSINet achieves both higher accuracy and better efficiency than advanced linear models and transformer models in TSF tasks.

Our HandMCM is a novel method based on the powerful state space model (Mamba). By incorporating modules for local information injection/filtering and correspondence modeling, the proposed correspondence Mamba effectively learns the highly dynamic kinematic topology of keypoints across various occlusion scenarios. Moreover, by integrating multi-modal image features, we enhance the robustness and representational capacity of the input, leading to more accurate hand pose estimation. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving severe occlusions.

To address these limitations, we propose Temperature Annealed Few step Sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (TAFS GRPO), a novel framework for training flow matching text to image models into efficient few step generators well aligned with human preferences. Our method iteratively injects adaptive temporal noise onto the results of one step samples. By repeatedly annealing the model's sampled outputs, it introduces stochasticity into the sampling process while preserving the semantic integrity of each generated image. Moreover, its step aware advantage integration mechanism combines the GRPO to avoid the need for the differentiable of reward function and provide dense and step specific rewards for stable policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAFS GRPO achieves strong performance in few step text to image generation and significantly improves the alignment of generated images with human preferences.

Recently, the emerging state-space model, namely Mamba, has shown great potential in balancing global receptive fields and computational efficiency. As a solution, we propose Saliency Mamba (Samba), a pure Mamba-based architecture that flexibly handles various distinct SOD tasks, including RGB/RGB-D/RGB-T SOD, video SOD (VSOD), RGB-D VSOD, and visible-depth-thermal SOD. Specifically, we rethink the scanning strategy of Mamba for SOD, and introduce a saliency-guided Mamba block (SGMB) that features a spatial neighborhood scanning (SNS) algorithm to preserve the spatial continuity of salient regions. A context-aware upsampling (CAU) method is also proposed to promote hierarchical feature alignment and aggregation by modeling contextual dependencies. As one step further, to avoid the \"task-specific\" problem as in previous SOD solutions, we develop Samba+, which is empowered by training Samba in a multi-task joint manner, leading to a more unified and versatile model. Two crucial components that collaboratively tackle challenges encountered in input of arbitrary modalities and continual adaptation are investigated. Specifically, a hub-and-spoke graph attention (HGA) module facilitates adaptive cross-modal interactive fusion, and a modality-anchored continual learning (MACL) strategy alleviates inter-modal conflicts together with catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Samba individually outperforms existing methods across six SOD tasks on 22 datasets with lower computational cost, whereas Samba+ achieves even superior results on these tasks and datasets by using a single trained versatile model. Additional results further demonstrate the potential of our Samba framework.",

In this work, we introduce Expected Harm, a metric that weights the severity of a jailbreak by its execution likelihood, modeled as a function of execution cost. Through empirical analysis of state-of-the-art models, we reveal a systematic Inverse Risk Calibration: models disproportionately exhibit stronger refusal behaviors for low-likelihood (high-cost) threats while remaining vulnerable to high-likelihood (low-cost) queries. We demonstrate that this miscalibration creates a structural vulnerability: by exploiting this property, we increase the attack success rate of existing jailbreaks by up to $2\\times$.

To address these challenges, we investigate structured pruning for FECCT and propose Spectral-Aligned Pruning (SAP), a structure-aware framework that enables cross-code reuse of structured pruning masks across codes by leveraging the spectrum of the corresponding bipartite graph. After pruning, SAP performs per-code recovery via parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA), enabling a shared pruned backbone while storing only small code-specific adapter parameters.

        "abstract": "Diffusion policies are expressive yet incur high inference latency. Flow Matching (FM) enables one-step generation, but integrating it into Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) is challenging: the optimal policy is an intractable energy-based distribution, and the efficient log-likelihood estimation required to balance exploration and exploitation suffers from severe discretization bias. We propose \\textbf{F}low-based \\textbf{L}og-likelihood-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{M}aximum \\textbf{E}ntropy RL (\\textbf{FLAME}), a principled framework that addresses these challenges. First, we derive a Q-Reweighted FM objective that bypasses partition function estimation via importance reweighting. Second, we design a decoupled entropy estimator that rigorously corrects bias, which enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Third, we integrate the MeanFlow formulation to achieve expressive and efficient one-step control. Empirical results on MuJoCo show that FLAME outperforms Gaussian baselines and matches multi-step diffusion policies with significantly lower inference cost.

Autoregressive models excel at sequential planning and constraint composition, yet struggle with tasks that require explicit spatial or physical grounding. Diffusion models, in contrast, capture rich spatial structure through high-dimensional generation, but lack the stepwise logical control needed to satisfy complex, multi-stage constraints or to reliably identify and correct errors. We introduce Collaborative Thoughts, a unified collaborative framework that enables autoregressive and diffusion models to reason and generate jointly through a closed-loop interaction. In Collaborative Thoughts, autoregressive models perform structured planning and constraint management, diffusion models instantiate these constraints as intermediate visual thoughts, and a vision-based critic module evaluates whether the visual thoughts satisfy the intended structural and physical requirements. This feedback is then used to iteratively refine subsequent planning and generation steps, mitigating error propagation across modalities. Importantly, Collaborative Thoughts uses the same collaborative loop regardless of whether the task is autoregressive question answering or diffusion-based visual generation. Through representative examples, we illustrate how Collaborative Thoughts can improve the reliability of spatial reasoning and the controllability of generation.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce ToPi, a training-free token pruning framework tailored for in-context generation in DiTs. Specifically, ToPi utilizes offline calibration-driven sensitivity analysis to identify pivotal attention layers, serving as a robust proxy for redundancy estimation. Leveraging these layers, we derive a novel influence metric to quantify the contribution of each context token for selective pruning, coupled with a temporal update strategy that adapts to the evolving diffusion trajectory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ToPi can achieve over 30\\% speedup in inference while maintaining structural fidelity and visual consistency across complex image generation tasks.",

Because both mechanisms can yield identical task success on the original interface, benchmark scores alone are not identifiable evidence of environment-invariant capability. We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation.

Minima trains a lightweight convolutional predictor to estimate layer- and patch-level sensitivity, applies a mixture of Tucker, tensor-train, and tensor-ring decompositions to low-sensitivity regions, performs a short healing fine-tune, and executes the resulting operators with custom Triton and CUDA kernels. The reduced memory footprint enables speculative decoding with a small draft model and a larger verifier. On Qwen3-32B at an 8k-token context window, Minima reduces peak VRAM from 64 GiB to 40 GiB. For a single active request, throughput increases from 40 tokens per second (baseline) to 50 tokens per second (Minima) and 75 tokens per second (Minima with speculative decoding). Under 50 parallel requests, throughput is 34, 44, and 53 tokens per second respectively, showing that Minima remains effective under high concurrency even when speculative decoding gains compress. We position Minima relative to recent tensor-network, low-rank plus quantization, and cross-layer sharing methods, and argue that it is a practical step toward more aggressive structural compression via shared tensor backbones with tiny per-layer adapters.",

However, we can't manage what we can't measure. Accurately quantifying the pools and fluxes in the carbon, nutrient, and water nexus of the agroecosystem is therefore essential for understanding the underlying drivers of GHG and developing effective mitigation strategies. Conventional approaches like soil sampling, process-based models, and black-box machine learning models are facing challenges such as data sparsity, high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and complex subsurface biogeochemical and physical processes. Developing new trustworthy approaches such as AI-empowered models, will require the AI-ready benchmark dataset and outlined protocols, which unfortunately do not exist. In this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind spatial-temporal agroecosystem GHG benchmark dataset that integrates physics-based model simulations from Ecosys and DayCent with real-world observations from eddy covariance flux towers and controlled-environment facilities. We evaluate the performance of various sequential deep learning models on carbon and nitrogen flux prediction, including LSTM-based models, temporal CNN-based model, and Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we explored transfer learning to leverage simulated data to improve the generalization of deep learning models on real-world observations.

        "abstract": "Unsupervised Skill Discovery (USD) aims to autonomously learn a diverse set of skills without relying on extrinsic rewards. One of the most common USD approaches is to maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between skill latent variables and states. However, MI-based methods tend to favor simple, static skills due to their invariance properties, limiting the discovery of dynamic, task-relevant behaviors. Distance-Maximizing Skill Discovery (DSD) promotes more dynamic skills by leveraging state-space distances, yet still fall short in encouraging comprehensive skill sets that engage all controllable factors or entities in the environment. In this work, we introduce SUSD, a novel framework that harnesses the compositional structure of environments by factorizing the state space into independent components (e.g., objects or controllable entities). SUSD allocates distinct skill variables to different factors, enabling more fine-grained control on the skill discovery process. A dynamic model also tracks learning across factors, adaptively steering the agent's focus toward underexplored factors. This structured approach not only promotes the discovery of richer and more diverse skills, but also yields a factorized skill representation that enables fine-grained and disentangled control over individual entities which facilitates efficient training of compositional downstream tasks via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our experimental results across three environments, with factors ranging from 1 to 10, demonstrate that our method can discover diverse and complex skills without supervision, significantly outperforming existing unsupervised skill discovery methods in factorized and complex environments.

In this paper, we propose MGF-softmax, a novel softmax reformulation based on the moment generating function (MGF) that replaces the softmax denominator with its moment-based counterpart. This reformulation substantially reduces multiplicative depth while preserving key properties of softmax and asymptotically converging to the exact softmax as the number of input tokens increases. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers and large language models show that MGF-softmax provides an efficient and accurate approximation of softmax in encrypted inference. In particular, it achieves inference accuracy close to that of high-depth exact methods, while requiring substantially lower computational cost through reduced multiplicative depth.",

However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.",

We present $\\texttt{PISCES}$, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, $\\texttt{PISCES}$ uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, $\\texttt{PISCES}$ is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short- and long-video generation show that $\\texttt{PISCES}$ outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness.

We show that this fixed geometry leads to highly conservative, volume-inefficient prediction regions when environments undergo structural shifts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{AdaptNC}, a framework for the joint online adaptation of both the nonconformity score parameters and the conformal threshold. AdaptNC leverages an adaptive reweighting scheme to optimize score functions, and introduces a replay buffer mechanism to mitigate the coverage instability that occurs during score transitions.

This is due to optimizing to match robot end-effector to human hand position and orientation, which can also limit the robot's workspace to that of the human. Instead, this paper reframes retargeting as an orientation alignment problem, enabling a closed-form, geometric solution algorithm with an optimality guarantee. The key idea is to align a robot arm to a human's upper and lower arm orientations, as identified from shoulder, elbow, and wrist (SEW) keypoints; hence, the method is called SEW-Mimic. The method has fast inference (3 kHz) on standard commercial CPUs, leaving computational overhead for downstream applications; an example in this paper is a safety filter to avoid bimanual self-collision. The method suits most 7-degree-of-freedom robot arms and humanoids, and is agnostic to input keypoint source. Experiments show that SEW-Mimic outperforms other retargeting methods in computation time and accuracy. A pilot user study suggests that the method improves teleoperation task success. Preliminary analysis indicates that data collected with SEW-Mimic improves policy learning due to being smoother. SEW-Mimic is also shown to be a drop-in way to accelerate full-body humanoid retargeting. Finally, hardware demonstrations illustrate SEW-Mimic's practicality. The results emphasize the utility of SEW-Mimic as a fundamental building block for bimanual robot manipulation and humanoid robot teleoperation.",

For a given approximate discrete state, we verify existence and local uniqueness of a weak solution in a computable neighbourhood via a Newton--Kantorovich argument based on three certified ingredients: a guaranteed dual-norm residual bound, a computable lower bound for the stability constant of the linearised operator, and a Lipschitz bound for the derivative on the verification ball. The residual bound is obtained by an equilibrated-flux reconstruction exploiting an explicit relation between nonconforming and mixed formulations, yielding $H(\\mathrm{div})$-conforming fluxes without local mixed solves. The stability ingredient follows from a computable coercivity lower bound for the linearisation. An admissible verification radius is selected by a simple bracketing--bisection search, justified for an affine Lipschitz model. Once the verification ball is certified, we derive guaranteed enclosures for quantities of interest using computable variation bounds; an adjoint-based correction, in the spirit of goal-oriented error estimation, tightens these intervals while retaining full rigour. Numerical experiments for semilinear diffusion--reaction models show that the certificates are informative and that the adjoint enhancement substantially reduces enclosure widths.",

Hallucinations are modeled as stochastic constraint violations, and we show that confidence-based selective prediction does not, in general, imply probabilistic risk guarantees. To enforce chance constraints efficiently, we propose a sequential, anytime-valid inference procedure that adaptively certifies feasibility or infeasibility using finite samples, avoiding conservative fixed-sample bounds.

Recently, adapting generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for retrieval offers a promising direction. However, we identify that this adaptation strategy overlooks a fundamental issue: adapting a generative MLLM into a single-embedding discriminative retriever triggers a paradigm conflict, which leads to Capability Degradation - the deterioration of native fine-grained reasoning after retrieval adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose ReCALL (Recalibrating Capability Degradation), a model-agnostic framework that follows a diagnose-generate-refine pipeline: Firstly, we diagnose cognitive blind spots of the retriever via self-guided informative instance mining. Next, we generate corrective instructions and triplets by CoT prompting the foundation MLLM and conduct quality control with VQA-based consistency filtering. Finally, we refine the retriever through continual training on these triplets with a grouped contrastive scheme, thereby internalizing fine-grained visual-semantic distinctions and realigning the discriminative embedding space of retriever with intrinsic compositional reasoning within the MLLM. Extensive experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show that ReCALL consistently recalibrates degraded capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released soon.",

This labor intensive paradigm drains computational and annotation resources, inflates costs, and distorts model rankings, ultimately stifling iterative development. To address this, we propose Agentic Automatic Evaluation (A2Eval), the first agentic framework that automates benchmark curation and evaluation through two collaborative agents. The Data Agent autonomously induces capability dimensions and assembles a balanced, compact evaluation suite, while the Eval Agent synthesizes and validates executable evaluation pipelines, enabling fully autonomous, high-fidelity assessment. Evaluated across 10 benchmarks and 13 models, A2Eval compresses evaluation suites by 85%, reduces overall computational costs by 77%, and delivers a 4.6x speedup while preserving evaluation quality. Crucially, A2Eval corrects systematic ranking biases, improves human alignment to Spearman's rho=0.85, and maintains high ranking fidelity (Kendall's tau=0.81), establishing a new standard for high-fidelity, low-cost embodied assessment.

        "abstract": "While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence.",

This paradigm shifts the focus from passive token preservation to active discovery of optimal compressed token combinations. Secondly, we propose a combinatorial policy optimization algorithm with online combination space sampling, which dramatically reduces the exploration space for video token combinations and accelerates the convergence speed of policy optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CaCoVID. Codes will be released.",

Yet SVs can be unreliable in practice. Some concepts are unsteerable, and even when steering helps on average it can backfire for a non-trivial fraction of inputs. Reliability also degrades in long-form generation and multi-attribute steering. We take a geometric view of these failures. A static SV applies the same update vector everywhere in representation space, implicitly assuming that the concept-improving direction is constant across contexts. When the locally effective direction varies with the current activation, a single global vector can become misaligned, which yields weak or reversed effects. Guided by this perspective, we propose Steering Vector Fields (SVF), which learns a differentiable concept scoring function whose local gradient defines the steering direction at each activation, making interventions explicitly context-dependent. This formulation supports coordinated multi-layer interventions in a shared, aligned concept space, and enables efficient long-form and multi-attribute control within a unified framework. Across multiple LLMs and steering tasks, SVF delivers stronger and more reliable control, improving the practicality of inference-time steering.",

From a theoretical perspective, we introduce a gradient-weighted modification of the coupled complex-boundary method (CCBM) incorporating an \\(H^1\\)-type term, and formulate the reconstruction as a regularized optimization problem over bounded admissible coefficients. We establish continuity and differentiability of the forward map, Lipschitz continuity of the modified cost functional, existence of minimizers, stability with respect to noisy data, and convergence under vanishing noise. From a numerical perspective, reconstructions are computed using a Sobolev-gradient descent scheme and evaluated through extensive numerical experiments across a range of noise levels, boundary inputs, and coefficient structures. In the reported tests, for sufficiently large but not excessive $H^1$-weights, the modified CCBM is observed to yield more stable reconstructions and to reduce certain high-frequency artifacts. Across the numerical scenarios considered in this study, the method often demonstrates favorable stability and robustness properties relative to several classical boundary-based formulations, although performance remains problem- and parameter-dependent. A projection-based extension further supports stable recovery of piecewise-constant diffusion coefficients in multi-subregion test cases. Our results indicate that, as long as all subdomains share a portion of the boundary, the proposed CCBM-based Tikhonov regularization approach with a pick-a-point strategy enables stable and reliable reconstruction of diffusion parameters.",

Unlike prior static data synthetic pipelines, our pipeline provides both frame-level labels for spatial learning and sequence-level supervision for temporal learning.

Our two-stage training strategy, combining static pretraining with dynamic sequence supervision, enables the model first to acquire robust spatial representations and then refine temporal consistency across motion-aligned sequences.

Existing approaches rely on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL), which provides limited guidance for regulating information acquisition. We propose DeepControl, a framework for adaptive information control based on a formal notion of information utility, which measures the marginal value of retrieved evidence under a given reasoning state. Building on this utility, we introduce retrieval continuation and granularity control mechanisms that selectively regulate when to continue and stop retrieval, and how much information to expand. An annealed control strategy enables the agent to internalize effective information acquisition behaviors during training. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines. In particular, our approach achieves average performance improvements of 9.4% and 8.6% on Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B, respectively, over strong outcome-based RL baselines, and consistently outperforms both retrieval-free and retrieval-based reasoning methods without explicit information control.

The system adopts a parallel pipeline with a VR Frontend and a GA Backend. The VR Frontend uses inverse kinematics to estimate full-body pose and streams the resulting pose along with stereo camera parameters to the backend. The GA Backend stereoscopically renders a 3DGS avatar reconstructed from a single image. To improve stereo rendering efficiency, we introduce Binocular Batching, which jointly processes left and right eye views in a single batched pass to reduce redundant computation and support high-resolution VR displays. We evaluate VRGaussianAvatar with quantitative performance tests and a within-subject user study against image- and video-based mesh avatar baselines. Results show that VRGaussianAvatar sustains interactive VR performance and yields higher perceived appearance similarity, embodiment, and plausibility.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{TRIP-Bench}, a long-horizon benchmark grounded in realistic travel-planning scenarios. TRIP-Bench leverages real-world data, offers 18 curated tools and 40+ travel requirements, and supports automated evaluation. It includes splits of varying difficulty; the hard split emphasizes long and ambiguous interactions, style shifts, feasibility changes, and iterative version revision. Dialogues span up to 15 user turns, can involve 150+ tool calls, and may exceed 200k tokens of context. Experiments show that even advanced models achieve at most 50\\% success on the easy split, with performance dropping below 10\\% on hard subsets. We further propose \\textbf{GTPO}, an online multi-turn reinforcement learning method with specialized reward normalization and reward differencing. Applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GTPO improves constraint satisfaction and interaction robustness, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro in our evaluation. We expect TRIP-Bench to advance practical long-horizon interactive agents, and GTPO to provide an effective online RL recipe for robust long-horizon training.",

Thus, numerous methods are proposed to introduce temporal cues to enhance tracking robustness. However, conventional CNN and Transformer architectures exhibit inherent limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies in visual tracking, often necessitating either complex customized modules or substantial computational costs to integrate temporal cues. Inspired by the success of the state space model, we propose a novel temporal modeling paradigm for visual tracking, termed State-aware Mamba Tracker (SMTrack), providing a neat pipeline for training and tracking without needing customized modules or substantial computational costs to build long-range temporal dependencies. It enjoys several merits. First, we propose a novel selective state-aware space model with state-wise parameters to capture more diverse temporal cues for robust tracking. Second, SMTrack facilitates long-range temporal interactions with linear computational complexity during training. Third, SMTrack enables each frame to interact with previously tracked frames via hidden state propagation and updating, which releases computational costs of handling temporal cues during tracking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SMTrack achieves promising performance with low computational costs.",

The dual formulation of the distance expresses the regularization as penalty terms applied to the reward via optimal dual variables, which yield a tractable objective compatible with standard RL algorithms.

Despite the absence of explicit topics, model outputs cover a broad semantic space, and surprisingly, each model family exhibits strong and systematic topical preferences. GPT-OSS predominantly generates programming (27.1%) and mathematical content (24.6%), whereas Llama most frequently generates literary content (9.1%). DeepSeek often generates religious content, while Qwen frequently generates multiple-choice questions. Beyond topical preferences, we also observe differences in content specialization and depth: GPT-OSS often generates more technically advanced content (e.g., dynamic programming) compared with other models (e.g., basic Python). Furthermore, we find that the near-unconstrained generation often degenerates into repetitive phrases, revealing interesting behaviors unique to each model family. For instance, degenerate outputs from Llama include multiple URLs pointing to personal Facebook and Instagram accounts.

We reconcile this tension by proposing LSTR (Latent Sparse Transcoder Reasoning), a latent reasoning framework that elevates functional sparse transcoders into active reasoning operators to perform multi-step computation through sparse semantic transitions. At its core, LSTR employs a Latent Transition Transcoder (LTT) with a residual skip architecture that decouples linear manifold transport from sparse semantic updates, enabling controllable semantic resolution via explicit sparsity constraints. Extensive experiments show that LSTR preserves reasoning accuracy and compression efficiency while substantially improving interpretability over dense latent baselines. Causal interventions and trajectory analyses further demonstrate that these sparse features act as both interpretable and causally effective operators in the reasoning process.",

This paper proposes CMAFNet, a Cross-Modal Alignment and Fusion Network that integrates RGB appearance and depth geometry through a principled purify-then-fuse paradigm. CMAFNet consists of a Semantic Recomposition Module that performs dictionary-based feature purification via a learned codebook to suppress modality-specific noise while preserving defect-discriminative information, and a Contextual Semantic Integration Framework that captures global spatial dependencies using partial-channel attention to enhance structural semantic reasoning. Position-wise normalization within the purification stage enforces explicit reconstruction-driven cross-modal alignment, ensuring statistical compatibility between heterogeneous features prior to fusion.

Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds.

As unstructured data, most information of multi-modal data (text, image, video, etc) hides in the semantics, which cannot be accessed by the traditional database queries like SQL.\nGiven the power of Large Language Model (LLM) in understanding semantics and processing natural language, in recent years several LLM-based semantic query systems have been proposed, to support semantic querying over unstructured data. However, this rapid growth has produced a fragmented ecosystem. Applications face significant integration challenges due to (1) disparate APIs of different semantic query systems and (2) a fundamental trade-off between specialization and generality. Many semantic query systems are highly specialized, offering state-of-the-art performance within a single modality but struggling with multi-modal data. Conversely, some \"all-in-one\" systems handle multiple modalities but often exhibit suboptimal performance compared to their specialized counterparts in specific modalities.\nThis paper introduces Meta Engine, a novel \"query system on query systems\", designed to resolve those aforementioned challenges. Meta Engine is a unified semantic query engine that integrates heterogeneous, specialized LLM-based query systems. Its architecture comprises five key components: (1) a Natural Language (NL) Query Parser, (2) an Operator Generator, (3) a Query Router, (4) a set of Adapters, and (5) a Result Aggregator. In the evaluation, Meta Engine consistently outperforms all baselines, yielding 3-6x higher F1 in most cases and up to 24x on specific datasets.",

By modeling exploration via guided diffusion, multi-step denoising distributes stochasticity and preserves multiple coexisting solution modes without mutual suppression. Furthermore, by decoupling latent-space exploration from text-space generation, we show that latent diffusion-based optimization is more effective than text-space policy optimization alone, while a complementary text policy provides additional gains when combined with latent exploration. Experiments on code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both pass@1 and pass@k over discrete RL baselines, with absolute pass@1 gains of +9.4% on code generation and +5.7% on mathematical reasoning, highlighting diffusion-based latent RL as a principled alternative to discrete token-level RL for reasoning.",

We propose Game of Thought (GoT), a framework that applies game-theoretic techniques to approximate a Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy for the restricted variant of the game. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves worst-case performance compared to (1) direct prompting-based methods and (2) heuristic-guided search methods across all tested settings.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in enterprise workflows, yet their performance remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) seeks to mitigate this instability, but existing approaches face two persistent challenges. First, commonly used prompt strategies rely on static instructions that perform well on average but fail to adapt to heterogeneous queries. Second, more dynamic approaches depend on offline reward models that are fundamentally correlational, confounding prompt effectiveness with query characteristics. We propose Causal Prompt Optimization (CPO), a framework that reframes prompt design as a problem of causal estimation. CPO operates in two stages. First, it learns an offline causal reward model by applying Double Machine Learning (DML) to semantic embeddings of prompts and queries, isolating the causal effect of prompt variations from confounding query attributes. Second, it utilizes this unbiased reward signal to guide a resource-efficient search for query-specific prompts without relying on costly online evaluation. We evaluate CPO across benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, visualization, and data analytics. CPO consistently outperforms human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art automated optimizers. The gains are driven primarily by improved robustness on hard queries, where existing methods tend to deteriorate. Beyond performance, CPO fundamentally reshapes the economics of prompt optimization: by shifting evaluation from real-time model execution to an offline causal model, it enables high-precision, per-query customization at a fraction of the inference cost required by online methods. Together, these results establish causal inference as a scalable foundation for reliable and cost-efficient prompt optimization in enterprise LLM deployments.",

Despite its widespread use, the mechanistic factors that govern when steering succeeds or fails remain poorly understood, as prior work has relied primarily on black-box outputs or LLM-based judges. In this study, we investigate whether the reliability of steering can be diagnosed using internal model signals. We focus on two information-theoretic measures: the entropy-derived Normalized Branching Factor (NBF), and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between steered activations and targeted concepts in the vocabulary space. We hypothesize that effective steering corresponds to structured entropy preservation and coherent KL alignment across decoding steps. Building on a reliability study demonstrating high inter-judge agreement between two architecturally distinct LLMs, we use LLM-generated annotations as ground truth and show that these mechanistic signals provide meaningful predictive power for identifying successful steering and estimating failure probability. We further introduce a stronger evaluation baseline for Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and Sparse Autoencoder-based steering, the two most widely adopted activation-steering methods.",

However, their deployment in long context scenarios remains hindered by computational inefficiency and information redundancy. Context compression methods address these challenges by significantly reducing input length and eliminating redundancy. We propose COMI, a coarse-to-fine adaptive context compression framework that jointly optimizes for semantic relevance and diversity under high compression rates. We introduce Marginal Information Gain (MIG), a metric defined as the relevance of a unit to the input query minus its semantic redundancy with other units, guiding the compression process to prioritize information that is both relevant and low redundant. The framework operates in two stages: (1) Coarse-Grained Group Reallocation, where the context is partitioned into groups and dynamically assigned compression rates based on inter-group MIG, ensuring compression budgets align with information value distribution; and (2) Fine-Grained Token Merging, where tokens within each group are fused via an intra-group MIG-based weighting mechanism, thereby preserving key semantics while avoiding the accumulation of redundancy. Extensive experiments across question-answering (e.g., NaturalQuestions, 2WikiMQA, HotpotQA and NarrativeQA), summarization (e.g., MultiNews) with various backbones (e.g., LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen2-7B) show that COMI outperforms existing baselines by a large margin, e.g., approximately 25-point Exact Match (EM) improvement under 32x compression constraint with Qwen2-7B on NaturalQuestions.",

From a theoretical perspective, we reveal that the applicability of these paradigms depends on the reducibility cost of domain-specific functions to domain-invariant ones. Building on this insight, we propose a Mutual-Guided Expert Collaboration (MGEC) framework that employs distinct network structures aligned with domain-specific and domain-invariant functions. Shared expert-guided learning captures reducible domain-invariant functions. Routed expert-guided learning employs a mixture-of-experts architecture to model irreducible domain-specific functions. Mutual-guided learning enables collaborative regularization to prevent over-reduction and under-reduction. We validate our theoretical findings on synthetic datasets, and experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that MGEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

By predicting collision possibility as a distribution, we extract both risk and uncertainty to guide the robot's actions. The uncertainty term encourages active perception, enabling simultaneous manipulation and information gathering to resolve occlusions. When combined with confidence maps that capture observation reliability, our approach enables safe navigation despite severe sensor occlusion. Extensive experiments across varying object sizes and obstacle configurations demonstrate that CURA-PPO achieves up to 3X higher success rates than the baselines, with learned behaviors that handle occlusions.

To break this instability mechanism, we propose MSign, a new optimizer that periodically applies matrix sign operations to restore stable rank.

A simple linear classifier trained on the frozen features of modern Vision Foundation Models , including Perception Encoder, MetaCLIP 2, and DINOv3, establishes a new state-of-the-art. Through a comprehensive evaluation spanning traditional benchmarks, unseen generators, and challenging in-the-wild distributions, we show that this baseline not only matches specialized detectors on standard benchmarks but also decisively outperforms them on in-the-wild datasets, boosting accuracy by striking margins of over 30\\%. We posit that this superior capability is an emergent property driven by the massive scale of pre-training data containing synthetic content. We trace the source of this capability to two distinct manifestations of data exposure: Vision-Language Models internalize an explicit semantic concept of forgery, while Self-Supervised Learning models implicitly acquire discriminative forensic features from the pretraining data. However, we also reveal persistent limitations: these models suffer from performance degradation under recapture and transmission, remain blind to VAE reconstruction and localized editing. We conclude by advocating for a paradigm shift in AI forensics, moving from overfitting on static benchmarks to harnessing the evolving world knowledge of foundation models for real-world reliability.",

We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding.

ARA operates in two stages: first, a Hacker policy discovers reward model vulnerabilities while an Auditor learns to detect exploitation from latent representations; second, Auditor-Guided RLHF (AG-RLHF) gates reward signals to penalize detected hacking, transforming reward hacking from an unobservable failure into a measurable, controllable signal. Experiments across three hacking scenarios demonstrate that ARA achieves the best alignment-utility tradeoff among all baselines: reducing sycophancy to near-SFT levels while improving helpfulness, decreasing verbosity while achieving the highest ROUGE-L, and suppressing code gaming while improving Pass@1. Beyond single-domain evaluation, we show that reward hacking, detection, and mitigation all generalize across domains -- a Hacker trained on code gaming exhibits increased sycophancy despite no reward for this behavior, and an Auditor trained on one domain effectively suppresses exploitation in others, enabling efficient multi-domain defense with a single model.",

In this paper, we propose WorldCup, a multi-bit watermarking framework for LLMs that treats sampling as a natural communication channel and embeds message bits directly into token selection via a hierarchical competition mechanism guided by complementary signals. Moreover, WorldCup further adopts entropy-aware modulation to preserve generation quality and supports robust message recovery through confidence-aware decoding.

        "abstract": "The proliferation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has established vector databases as critical infrastructure, yet they introduce severe privacy risks via embedding inversion attacks. Existing paradigms face a fundamental trade-off: optimization-based methods require computationally prohibitive queries, while alignment-based approaches hinge on the unrealistic assumption of accessible in-domain training data. These constraints render them ineffective in strict black-box and cross-domain settings. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce Zero2Text, a novel training-free framework based on recursive online alignment. Unlike methods relying on static datasets, Zero2Text synergizes LLM priors with a dynamic ridge regression mechanism to iteratively align generation to the target embedding on-the-fly. We further demonstrate that standard defenses, such as differential privacy, fail to effectively mitigate this adaptive threat. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate Zero2Text; notably, on MS MARCO against the OpenAI victim model, it achieves 1.8x higher ROUGE-L and 6.4x higher BLEU-2 scores compared to baselines, recovering sentences from unknown domains without a single leaked data pair.",

Speculative decoding methods have emerged as a promising solution to accelerate LLM decoding, attracting attention from both systems and AI research communities. Recently, the pursuit of better draft quality has driven a trend toward parametrically larger draft models, which inevitably introduces substantial computational overhead. While existing work attempts to balance the trade-off between prediction accuracy and compute latency, we address this fundamental dilemma through architectural innovation.\nWe propose PRISM, which disaggregates the computation of each predictive step across different parameter sets, refactoring the computational pathways of draft models to successfully decouple model capacity from inference cost. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PRISM outperforms all existing draft architectures, achieving exceptional acceptance lengths while maintaining minimal draft latency for superior end-to-end speedup. We also re-examine scaling laws with PRISM, revealing that PRISM scales more effectively with expanding data volumes than other draft architectures. Through rigorous and fair comparison, we show that PRISM boosts the decoding throughput of an already highly optimized inference engine by more than 2.6x.",

To mitigate the quadratic complexity of standard full attention, various efficient attention mechanisms, such as linear and hybrid attention, have been developed. A fundamental gap remains: their expressive power relative to full attention lacks a rigorous theoretical characterization. In this work, we theoretically characterize the performance differences among these attention mechanisms. Our theory applies to all linear attention variants that can be formulated as a recurrence, including Mamba, DeltaNet, etc. Specifically, we establish an expressiveness hierarchy: for the sequential function composition-a multi-step reasoning task that must occur within a model's forward pass, an ($L+1$)-layer full attention network is sufficient, whereas any hybrid network interleaving $L-1$ layers of full attention with a substantially larger number ($2^{3L^2}$) of linear attention layers cannot solve it. This result demonstrates a clear separation in expressive power between the two types of attention. Our work provides the first provable separation between hybrid attention and standard full attention, offering a theoretical perspective for understanding the fundamental capabilities and limitations of different attention mechanisms.",

To overcome this, we introduce the Collaborative Memory Transformer (CoMeT), a novel architecture that enables LLMs to handle arbitrarily long sequences with constant memory usage and linear time complexity. Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy. The effectiveness of our approach is remarkable: a model equipped with CoMeT and fine-tuned on 32k contexts can accurately retrieve a passkey from any position within a 1M token sequence. On the SCROLLS benchmark, CoMeT surpasses other efficient methods and achieves performance comparable to a full-attention baseline on summarization tasks. Its practical effectiveness is further validated on real-world agent and user behavior QA tasks. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/comet-B00B/",

Due to the lack of access to internal states, such feedback overlooks the fine-grained conflicts between different modalities that lead to hallucinations during generation.\nTo address this issue, we propose IRIS (Implicit Reward-Guided Internal Sifting), which leverages continuous implicit rewards in the native log-probability space to preserve full information density and capture internal modal competition. This on-policy paradigm eliminates learnability gaps by utilizing self-generated preference pairs. By sifting these pairs based on multimodal implicit rewards, IRIS ensures that optimization is driven by signals that directly resolve modal conflicts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IRIS achieves highly competitive performance on key hallucination benchmarks using only 5.7k samples, without requiring any external feedback during preference alignment. These results confirm that IRIS provides an efficient and principled paradigm for mitigating MLLM hallucinations.",

Existing approaches mainly either verbalize graphs into natural language, which leads to excessive token consumption and scattered attention, or transform graphs into trainable continuous embeddings (i.e., soft prompt), but exhibit severe misalignment with original text tokens. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate one special token <SOG_k> to fully represent the Structure Of Graph within a unified token space, facilitating explicit topology input and structural information sharing. Specifically, we propose a topology-aware structural tokenizer that maps each graph topology into a highly selective single token.

With this approach, <SOG_k> empowers LLMs to understand, generate, and reason in a concise and accurate manner. Extensive experiments on five graph-level benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving a performance improvement of 9.9% to 41.4% compared to the baselines while exhibiting interpretability and consistency.

While this paradigm has driven substantial progress, it proves insufficient in adaptive and multi-turn settings where forecasting requires informative feature extraction, reasoning-driven inference, iterative refinement, and continual adaptation over time. In this paper, we argue for agentic time series forecasting (ATSF), which reframes forecasting as an agentic process composed of perception, planning, action, reflection, and memory. Rather than focusing solely on predictive models, ATSF emphasizes organizing forecasting as an agentic workflow that can interact with tools, incorporate feedback from outcomes, and evolve through experience accumulation. We outline three representative implementation paradigms -- workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and a hybrid agentic workflow paradigm -- and discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise when shifting from model-centric prediction to agentic forecasting. Together, this position aims to establish agentic forecasting as a foundation for future research at the intersection of time series forecasting.",

To bridge this gap, we are the first to adopt a data-centric perspective to systematically investigate how data distribution impacts compression quality, including two dimensions: input data and intrinsic data (i.e., the model's internal pretrained knowledge). We evaluate the semantic integrity of compressed representations using an autoencoder-based framework to systematically investigate it. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) encoder-measured input entropy negatively correlates with compression quality, while decoder-measured entropy shows no significant relationship under a frozen-decoder setting; and (2) the gap between intrinsic data of the encoder and decoder significantly diminishes compression gains, which is hard to mitigate. Based on these findings, we further present practical guidelines to optimize compression gains.",

Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference.",

However, these rewards are inherently sparse, failing to provide the fine-grained supervision necessary for generating complex, long-form trajectories.

The GVQ-based codec adopts separate VQs to produce mutually independent tokens, enabling efficient parallel token prediction in ParaGSE. Specifically, ParaGSE leverages the GVQ-based codec to encode degraded speech into distinct tokens, predicts the corresponding clean tokens through parallel branches conditioned on degraded spectral features, and ultimately reconstructs clean speech via the codec decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that ParaGSE consistently produces superior enhanced speech compared to both discriminative and generative baselines, under a wide range of distortions including noise, reverberation, band-limiting, and their mixtures. Furthermore, empowered by parallel computation in token prediction, ParaGSE attains about a 1.5-fold improvement in generation efficiency on CPU compared with serial generative speech enhancement approaches.",

Current defenses typically face a critical trade-off: prevention-based fine-tuning often degrades general utility via the \"alignment tax\", while detection-based filtering incurs prohibitive latency and memory costs. To bridge this gap, we propose RedVisor, a unified framework that synthesizes the explainability of detection systems with the seamless integration of prevention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, RedVisor is the first approach to leverage fine-grained reasoning paths to simultaneously detect attacks and guide the model's safe response. We implement this via a lightweight, removable adapter positioned atop the frozen backbone. This adapter serves a dual function: it first generates an explainable analysis that precisely localizes the injection and articulates the threat, which then explicitly conditions the model to reject the malicious command. Uniquely, the adapter is active only during this reasoning phase and is effectively muted during the subsequent response generation. This architecture yields two distinct advantages: (1) it mathematically preserves the backbone's original utility on benign inputs; and (2) it enables a novel KV Cache Reuse strategy, eliminating the redundant prefill computation inherent to decoupled pipelines. We further pioneer the integration of this defense into the vLLM serving engine with custom kernels. Experiments demonstrate that RedVisor outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in detection accuracy and throughput while incurring negligible utility loss.",

However, many existing systems rely on stochastic routing or ad-hoc heuristics, making their behavior difficult to reproduce and their decision process hard to interpret. We propose ORCH, a deterministic coordination framework for discrete-choice reasoning that orchestrates heterogeneous LLMs. ORCH follows a ``many analyses, one decision'' paradigm: multiple base models independently produce structured analyses, and a dedicated merge agent outputs the final choice. The framework uses fixed rules for task decomposition and answer aggregation, keeping the pipeline predictable, reproducible, and training-free. Determinism here refers to fixed routing and aggregation rules under a fixed evaluation protocol, rather than strict bit-level reproducibility across deployments. To exploit model complementarity, we optionally introduce an EMA-guided router that updates agent selection using historical accuracy, latency, or cost; since it relies on answer-based feedback, it is mainly intended for benchmarking, controlled evaluation, or delayed-feedback settings. Experiments on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GSM8K show that ORCH consistently outperforms single-model baselines and a majority-vote ensemble. On MMLU-Pro, ORCH improves accuracy by over 10 points compared to the strongest baseline, and on GSM8K it yields gains exceeding 50 points; McNemar tests confirm statistical significance. The EMA router provides an additional 0.7--2.0 point accuracy boost, and ablations show that both multi-agent collaboration and routing contribute substantially. Overall, ORCH offers a practical path toward controllable, interpretable, and deployment-ready LLM-based agent systems for discrete-choice reasoning.",

This paper presents the Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Long Term Forecasting (STT-LTF ), an extended framework that advances beyond purely temporal analysis to integrate spatial context modeling with temporal sequence prediction. STT-LTF processes multi-scale spatial patches alongside temporal sequences (up to 20 years) through a unified transformer architecture, capturing both local neighborhood relationships and regional climate influences. The framework employs comprehensive self-supervised learning with spatial masking, temporal masking, and horizon sampling strategies, enabling robust model training from 40 years of unlabeled Landsat imagery. Unlike autoregressive approaches, STT-LTF directly predicts arbitrary future time points without error accumulation, incorporating spatial patch embeddings, cyclical temporal encoding, and geographic coordinates to learn complex dependencies across heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Experimental evaluation on Landsat data (1984-2024) demonstrates that STT-LTF achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0328 and R^2 of 0.8412 for next-year predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods, CNN-based approaches, LSTM networks, and standard transformers. The framework's ability to handle irregular temporal sampling and variable prediction horizons makes it particularly suitable for analysis of heterogeneous landscapes experiencing rapid ecological transitions.",

        "abstract": "Autoregressive video diffusion models enable streaming generation, opening the door to long-form synthesis, video world models, and interactive neural game engines. However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.",

To address these challenges, we propose FlowBypass, a novel and analytical framework grounded in Rectified Flow that constructs a bypass directly connecting inversion and reconstruction trajectories, thereby mitigating error accumulation without relying on feature manipulations. We provide a formal derivation of two trajectories, from which we obtain an approximate bypass formulation and its numerical solution, enabling seamless trajectory transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowBypass consistently outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods, achieving stronger prompt alignment while preserving high-fidelity details in irrelevant regions.",

Both paradigms rely on word embeddings not only to represent the input sentence, but also to represent the target sentence that backbone models are trained to predict. We argue that such static embedding of the target word is insensitive to neighboring words, encouraging locally accurate word prediction while neglecting global structure across the target sentence. To address this limitation, we propose a continuous sentence representation, termed sentence curve, defined as a spline curve whose control points affect multiple words in the sentence. Based on this representation, we introduce sentence curve language model (SCLM), which extends DLMs to predict sentence curves instead of the static word embeddings. We theoretically show that sentence curve prediction induces a regularization effect that promotes global structure modeling, and characterize how different sentence curve types affect this behavior. Empirically, SCLM achieves SOTA performance among DLMs on IWSLT14 and WMT14, shows stable training without burdensome knowledge distillation, and demonstrates promising potential compared to discrete DLMs on LM1B.",

GPD introduces a novel training strategy in which a teacher model progressively guides a student model to operate with larger step sizes. The framework consists of two key components: (1) an online-generated training target that reduces optimization difficulty while improving computational efficiency, and (2) frequency-domain constraints in the latent space that promote the preservation of fine-grained details and temporal dynamics. Applied to the Wan2.1 model, GPD reduces the number of sampling steps from 48 to 6 while maintaining competitive visual quality on VBench. Compared with existing distillation methods, GPD demonstrates clear advantages in both pipeline simplicity and quality preservation.",

However, these evaluations typically rely on standard in-distribution data, leaving the robustness of MLLMs largely unexamined when faced with scenarios that defy common-sense priors. To address this gap, we introduce VIA-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to probe model performance on visual illusions and anomalies. It includes six core categories: color illusions, motion illusions, gestalt illusions, geometric and spatial illusions, general visual illusions, and visual anomalies. Through careful human-in-the-loop review, we construct over 1K high-quality question-answer pairs that require nuanced visual reasoning. Extensive evaluation of over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning-enhanced models, uncovers significant vulnerabilities. Notably, we find that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning offers negligible robustness, often yielding ``brittle mirages'' where the model's logic collapses under illusory stimuli. Our findings reveal a fundamental divergence between machine and human perception, suggesting that resolving such perceptual bottlenecks is critical for the advancement of artificial general intelligence.

While recent studies attribute this to \"training inference mismatch stemming\" from inconsistent hybrid engines, standard remedies, such as Importance Sampling, might fail during extended training runs. In this work, we analyze this instability through the lens of optimization, demonstrating that gradient noise and training-inference mismatch escalate in tandem as training progresses. Meanwhile, we find that the mismatch can be effectively suppressed by shrinking the update size. Taken together, we deduce that the mismatch is not merely a static numerical discrepancy, but a dynamic failure coupled with the model's optimization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution: a specialized Learning Rate (LR) scheduler. Instead of pre-defined decay schedule in traditional LR scheduler, our method dynamically triggers LR decay based on response length, which we identify as a reliable early-warning signal for impending instability. Empirical evidence suggests that by reducing the learning rate as gradient noise rises, we can consistently stabilize RL training and keep the training-inference mismatch at a safe level.",

In a VQ-VAE-based semantic communication system, the transmission rate is directly governed by the size of a discrete codebook known as knowledge base (KB). However, the KB size is a fixed hyperparameter, meaning that adapting the rate requires training and storing a separate model for each desired size -- a practice that is too computationally and storage-prohibitive to achieve truly granular rate control. To address this, we introduce a principled, zero-shot KB resizing method that enables on-the-fly rate adaptation without any retraining. Our approach establishes a global importance ranking for all vectors within a single, large parent KB by uncovering its inherent semantic hierarchy. This is achieved via a three-step framework: 1) embedding KB vectors into hyperbolic space to reveal their hierarchical relationships; 2) constructing a master semantic tree using a minimum spanning tree algorithm; 3) enabling instant resizing by iteratively pruning the least important leaf nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method achieves reconstruction quality nearly identical to that of dedicated KBs trained from scratch, while demanding only a fraction of the computational budget. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior robustness at very low rates, where conventional KBs suffer from catastrophic failure. Our work resolves a fundamental limitation of VQ-VAE-based semantic communication systems, offering a practical and efficient path toward flexible and rate-adaptive semantic communication.",

Inspired by human reading behavior (i.e., close reading important content while skimming less relevant content), RAM partitions the context into segments and encodes them with the input query in parallel. High-relevance segments are fully retained (close reading), while low-relevance ones are query-guided compressed into compact summary vectors (skimming). Both explicit textual segments and implicit summary vectors are concatenated and fed into decoder to achieve both superior performance and natural language format interpretability. To refine the decision boundary between close reading and skimming, we further introduce a contrastive learning objective based on positive and negative query-segment pairs.

As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug. We introduce ROMA (Recursive Open Meta-Agents), a domain-agnostic framework that addresses these limitations through recursive task decomposition and structured aggregation. ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\\% over Kimi-Researcher.

We address this problem by launching multiple interacting diffusion processes in parallel, referred to as particles, for trajectory exploration. Importantly, we introduce the trajectory-level confidence as a self-rewarding signal for assigning particle importance weights. During sampling, particles are iteratively weighted and resampled to systematically steer generation towards globally confident, high-quality samples. Our self-rewarding SMC is verified on various masked diffusion language models and benchmarks, achieving significant improvement without extra training or reward guidance, while effectively converting parallel inference capacity into improved sampling quality.

        "abstract": "IMU-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has enabled a wide range of ubiquitous computing applications, yet its dominant clip classification paradigm cannot capture the rich temporal structure of real-world behaviors. This motivates a shift toward IMU Temporal Action Localization (IMU-TAL), which predicts both action categories and their start/end times in continuous streams. However, current progress is strongly bottlenecked by the need for dense, frame-level boundary annotations, which are costly and difficult to scale. To address this bottleneck, we introduce WS-IMUBench, a systematic benchmark study of weakly supervised IMU-TAL (WS-IMU-TAL) under only sequence-level labels. Rather than proposing a new localization algorithm, we evaluate how well established weakly supervised localization paradigms from audio, image, and video transfer to IMU-TAL under only sequence-level labels. We benchmark seven representative weakly supervised methods on seven public IMU datasets, resulting in over 3,540 model training runs and 7,080 inference evaluations. Guided by three research questions on transferability, effectiveness, and insights, our findings show that (i) transfer is modality-dependent, with temporal-domain methods generally more stable than image-derived proposal-based approaches; (ii) weak supervision can be competitive on favorable datasets (e.g., with longer actions and higher-dimensional sensing); and (iii) dominant failure modes arise from short actions, temporal ambiguity, and proposal quality. Finally, we outline concrete directions for advancing WS-IMU-TAL (e.g., IMU-specific proposal generation, boundary-aware objectives, and stronger temporal reasoning). Beyond individual results, WS-IMUBench establishes a reproducible benchmarking template, datasets, protocols, and analyses, to accelerate community-wide progress toward scalable WS-IMU-TAL.",

Existing designs suffer from two limitations: (i) they do not fully leverage the entire history for treatment allocation; (ii) they rely on strong assumptions to approximate the objective function (e.g., the mean squared error of the estimated treatment effect) for optimizing the design. We first establish an impossibility theorem showing that failure to condition on the full history leads to suboptimal designs, due to the dynamic dependencies in time series experiments. To address both limitations simultaneously, we next propose a transformer reinforcement learning (RL) approach which leverages transformers to condition allocation on the entire history and employs RL to directly optimize the MSE without relying on restrictive assumptions. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data, a publicly available dispatch simulator, and a real-world ridesharing dataset demonstrate that our proposal consistently outperforms existing designs.",

This paper presents a novel, data-efficient deep learning framework designed to achieve precise and accurate control using minimal sensor hardware. Leveraging an external dataset of 8 subjects, our approach implements a hybrid Transformer optimized for sparse, two-channel surface electromyography (sEMG). Unlike standard architectures that use fixed positional encodings, we integrate Time2Vec learnable temporal embeddings to capture the stochastic temporal warping inherent in biological signals. Furthermore, we employ a normalized additive fusion strategy that aligns the latent distributions of spatial and temporal features, preventing the destructive interference common in standard implementations. A two-stage curriculum learning protocol is utilized to ensure robust feature extraction despite data scarcity. The proposed architecture achieves a state-of-the-art multi-subject F1-score of 95.7% $\\pm$ 0.20% for a 10-class movement set, statistically outperforming both a standard Transformer with fixed encodings and a recurrent CNN-LSTM model. Architectural optimization reveals that a balanced allocation of model capacity between spatial and temporal dimensions yields the highest stability. Furthermore, while direct transfer to a new unseen subject led to poor accuracy due to domain shifts, a rapid calibration protocol utilizing only two trials per gesture recovered performance from 21.0% $\\pm$ 2.98% to 96.9% $\\pm$ 0.52%. By validating that high-fidelity temporal embeddings can compensate for low spatial resolution, this work challenges the necessity of high-density sensing.

Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, we propose SOPRAG, a novel framework specifically designed to address the above pain points in SOP retrieval. SOPRAG replaces flat chunking with specialized Entity, Causal, and Flow graph experts to resolve industrial structural and logical complexities. To optimize and coordinate these experts, we propose a Procedure Card layer that prunes the search space to eliminate computational noise, and an LLM-Guided gating mechanism that dynamically weights these experts to align retrieval with operator intent. To address the scarcity of domain-specific data, we also introduce an automated, multi-agent workflow for benchmark construction. Extensive experiments across four industrial domains demonstrate that SOPRAG significantly outperforms strong lexical, dense, and graph-based RAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response utility, achieving perfect execution scores in real-world critical tasks.",

Existing methods either ignore LQ-Ref correlations or rely on brittle explicit matching, leading to over-reliance on misleading references or under-utilization of valuable cues. To address this, we propose Ada-RefSR, a single-step diffusion framework guided by a \"Trust but Verify\" principle: reference information is leveraged when reliable and suppressed otherwise. Its core component, Adaptive Implicit Correlation Gating (AICG), employs learnable summary tokens to distill dominant reference patterns and capture implicit correlations with LQ features. Integrated into the attention backbone, AICG provides lightweight, adaptive regulation of reference guidance, serving as a built-in safeguard against erroneous fusion. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that Ada-RefSR achieves a strong balance of fidelity, naturalness, and efficiency, while remaining robust under varying reference alignment.",

To achieve reliable reusability without capability degradation, we introduce Non-Parametric PPO, which leverages semantic gradients for high-quality candidate generation and a PPO Gate for robust Skill verification. Through score-based maintenance, ProcMEM sustains compact, high-quality procedural memory. Experimental results across in-domain, cross-task, and cross-agent scenarios demonstrate that ProcMEM achieves superior reuse rates and significant performance gains with extreme memory compression. Visualized evolutionary trajectories and Skill distributions further reveal how ProcMEM transparently accumulates, refines, and reuses procedural knowledge to facilitate long-term autonomy.",

In this work, we propose a novel PINN architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which offer greater flexibility in choosing activation functions and can represent functions with fewer parameters. Specifically, we introduce a dual KANs structure that couples two KANs across subdomains and explicitly enforces interface conditions. To further boost training efficiency and convergence, we integrate the RAR-D adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically refine training points. Numerical experiments on the elliptic interface problems yield more uniform error distributions across the computational domain, which demonstrates that our PINN-based KANs achieve superior accuracy with significantly smaller network sizes and faster convergence compared to standard PINNs.",

These limitations hinder efficient and controllable image and video editing. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical proxy-based parametric image representation that disentangles semantic, geometric, and textural attributes into independent and manipulable parameter spaces. Based on a semantic-aware decomposition of the input image, our representation constructs hierarchical proxy geometries through adaptive Bezier fitting and iterative internal region subdivision and meshing. Multi-scale implicit texture parameters are embedded into the resulting geometry-aware distributed proxy nodes, enabling continuous high-fidelity reconstruction in the pixel domain and instance- or part-independent semantic editing. In addition, we introduce a locality-adaptive feature indexing mechanism to ensure spatial texture coherence, which further supports high-quality background completion without relying on generative models. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction and editing benchmarks, including ImageNet, OIR-Bench, and HumanEdit, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering fidelity with significantly fewer parameters, while enabling intuitive, interactive, and physically plausible manipulation. Moreover, by integrating proxy nodes with Position-Based Dynamics, our framework supports real-time physics-driven animation using lightweight implicit rendering, achieving superior temporal consistency and visual realism compared with generative approaches.",

To address this gap, we introduce ES-MemEval, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates five core memory capabilities: information extraction, temporal reasoning, conflict detection, abstention, and user modeling, in long-term emotional support settings, covering question answering, summarization, and dialogue generation tasks. To support the benchmark, we also propose EvoEmo, a multi-session dataset for personalized long-term emotional support that captures fragmented, implicit user disclosures and evolving user states. Extensive experiments on open-source long-context, commercial, and retrieval-augmented (RAG) LLMs show that explicit long-term memory is essential for reducing hallucinations and enabling effective personalization.

Without altering the mechanism, we view standard attention through a top-N selection lens and study its behaviour directly in value-state space. We define geometric metrics - Precision, Recall, and F-score - to quantify separability between selected and non-selected tokens, and derive non-asymptotic bounds with explicit dependence on dimension and margin under empirically motivated assumptions (stable value norms with a compressed sink token, exponential similarity decay, and piecewise attention weight profiles). The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics. Empirically, across LLaMA-2-7B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B, measurements closely track the theoretical envelopes: top-N selection sharpens separability, sink similarity correlates with Recall. We also found that in LLaMA-2-7B heads specialize into three regimes - Retriever, Mixer, Reset - with distinct geometric signatures. Overall, attention behaves as a structured geometric classifier with measurable criteria for token selection, offering head level interpretability and informing geometry-aware sparsification and design of attention in LLMs.",

We introduce \\emph{internal flow signatures} that audit decision formation from depthwise dynamics at a fixed inter-block monitoring boundary. The method stabilizes token-wise motion via bias-centered monitoring, then summarizes trajectories in compact \\emph{moving} readout-aligned subspaces constructed from the top token and its close competitors within each depth window. Neighboring window frames are aligned by an orthogonal transport, yielding depth-comparable transported step lengths, turning angles, and subspace drift summaries that are invariant to within-window basis choices. A lightweight GRU validator trained on these signatures performs self-checking without modifying the base model. Beyond detection, the validator localizes a culprit depth event and enables a targeted refinement: the model rolls back to the culprit token and clamps an abnormal transported step at the identified block while preserving the orthogonal residual. The resulting pipeline provides actionable localization and low-overhead self-checking from internal decision dynamics. \\emph{Code is available at} \\texttt{http://github.com/EavnJeong/Internal-Flow-Signatures-for-Self-Checking-and-Refinement-in-LLMs}.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are plagued by exorbitant inference costs attributable to the profusion of visual tokens within the vision encoder. The redundant visual tokens engenders a substantial computational load and key-value (KV) cache footprint bottleneck. Existing approaches focus on token-wise optimization, leveraging diverse intricate token pruning techniques to eliminate non-crucial visual tokens. Nevertheless, these methods often unavoidably undermine the integrity of the KV cache, resulting in failures in long-text generation tasks. To this end, we conduct an in-depth investigation towards the attention mechanism of the model from a new perspective, and discern that attention within more than half of all decode layers are semantic similar. Upon this finding, we contend that the attention in certain layers can be streamlined by inheriting the attention from their preceding layers. Consequently, we propose Lazy Attention, an efficient attention mechanism that enables cross-layer sharing of similar attention patterns. It ingeniously reduces layer-wise redundant computation in attention. In Lazy Attention, we develop a novel layer-shared cache, Q Cache, tailored for MLLMs, which facilitates the reuse of queries across adjacent layers. In particular, Q Cache is lightweight and fully compatible with existing inference frameworks, including Flash Attention and KV cache. Additionally, our method is highly flexible as it is orthogonal to existing token-wise techniques and can be deployed independently or combined with token pruning approaches. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method can reduce KV cache usage by over 35% and achieve 1.5x throughput improvement, while sacrificing only approximately 1% of performance on various MLLMs. Compared with SOTA token-wise methods, our technique achieves superior accuracy preservation.",

Although transformer-based models have shown strong potential for HSIC, existing approaches often struggle to achieve sufficient spectral discriminability while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DSXFormer, a novel dual-pooling spectral squeeze-expansion transformer with Dynamic Context Attention for HSIC. The proposed DSXFormer introduces a Dual-Pooling Spectral Squeeze-Expansion (DSX) block, which exploits complementary global average and max pooling to adaptively recalibrate spectral feature channels, thereby enhancing spectral discriminability and inter-band dependency modeling. In addition, DSXFormer incorporates a Dynamic Context Attention (DCA) mechanism within a window-based transformer architecture to dynamically capture local spectral-spatial relationships while significantly reducing computational overhead. The joint integration of spectral dual-pooling squeeze-expansion and DCA enables DSXFormer to achieve an effective balance between spectral emphasis and spatial contextual representation. Furthermore, patch extraction, embedding, and patch merging strategies are employed to facilitate efficient multi-scale feature learning. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used hyperspectral benchmark datasets, including Salinas (SA), Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University (PU), and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), demonstrate that DSXFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving classification accuracies of 99.95%, 98.91%, 99.85%, and 98.52%, respectively.",

Existing approaches, however, face critical limitations. Supervised models require impractical amounts of labeled data. Foundation models for activity recognition focus only on inertial sensors, failing to address the unique characteristics of smart-home binary sensor events: their sparse, discrete nature combined with rich semantic associations. LLM-based approaches, while tested in this domain, still raise several issues regarding the need for natural language descriptions or prompting, and reliance on either external services or expensive hardware, making them infeasible in real-life scenarios due to privacy and cost concerns. We introduce DomusFM, the first foundation model specifically designed and pretrained for smart-home sensor data. DomusFM employs a self-supervised dual contrastive learning paradigm to capture both token-level semantic attributes and sequence-level temporal dependencies. By integrating semantic embeddings from a lightweight language model and specialized encoders for temporal patterns and binary states, DomusFM learns generalizable representations that transfer across environments and tasks related to activity and event analysis. Through leave-one-dataset-out evaluation across seven public smart-home datasets, we demonstrate that DomusFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different downstream tasks, achieving superior performance even with only 5% of labeled training data available for fine-tuning.

To address these, we introduce FlashTrace, an efficient multi-token attribution method that employs span-wise aggregation to compute attribution over multi-token targets in a single pass, while maintaining faithfulness. Moreover, we design a recursive attribution mechanism that traces importance through intermediate reasoning chains back to source inputs. Extensive experiments on long-context retrieval (RULER) and multi-step reasoning (MATH, MorehopQA) tasks demonstrate that FlashTrace achieves over 130x speedup over existing baselines while maintaining superior faithfulness. We further analyze the dynamics of recursive attribution, showing that even a single recursive hop improves faithfulness by tracing importance through the reasoning chain.",

Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models.",

This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation.

We further come up with a Bimanual Active Perception (BAP) strategy, which leverages one arm to provide active vision and another arm to provide force sensing while manipulating. Based on this idea, we collect a dataset named BAPData for the tasks in EFM-10. With the dataset, we successfully verify the effectiveness of the BAP strategy in an imitation learning manner. We hope that the EFM-10 benchmark along with the BAP strategy can become a cornerstone that facilitates future research towards this direction. Project website: http://EFManipulation.github.io.",

This enables highly dynamic interaction control while preserving the wide workspace of the robot. Traditionally, position control is assigned to the macro manipulator, while the micro manipulator handles the interaction with the environment, limiting the achievable interaction control bandwidth. To solve this, we propose a novel control architecture that incorporates the macro manipulator into the active interaction control. This leads to a increase in control bandwidth by a factor of 2.1 compared to the state of the art architecture, based on the leader-follower approach and factor 12.5 compared to traditional robot-based force control. Further we propose surrogate models for a more efficient controller design and easy adaptation to hardware changes. We validate our approach by comparing it against the other control schemes in different experiments, like collision with an object, following a force trajectory and industrial assembly tasks.",

To address this, we propose the Diversity Score (DS), a metric that quantifies layout diversity under fixed constraints. Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel two-stage LLM-based framework that decouples knowledge acquisition from query generation. In the Exploration Stage, the system autonomously constructs a database-specific knowledge base by navigating the schema with a Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired strategy, generating triplets of schema fragments, executable queries, and natural language descriptions as usage examples. In the Deployment Stage, a dual-agent system leverages the collected knowledge as in-context examples to iteratively retrieve relevant information and generate accurate SQL queries in response to user questions. This design enables the agent to proactively familiarize itself with unseen databases and handle complex, multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy over strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability.",

Theoretically grounded in a Bias-Variance Decomposition, our approach approximates EU via Jensen-Shannon divergence among drafts (variance proxy) and KL divergence between the draft mixture and the target (bias proxy). To further ensure accuracy without significant overhead, we introduce Online Stochastic Distillation (OSD) to efficiently approximate target aggregation and the Data-Diverse Drafts (DDD) strategy to enhance draft diversity for better target approximation. Extensive experiments on GSM8K demonstrate that our method reduces the estimation error (RMSE) by up to 37% compared to baselines.

However, as AI increasingly permeates society's information environments, those become more adaptive and evolving: LLM-based chatbots participate in extended interaction, maintain conversational histories, mirror social cues, and can hypercustomize responses, thereby shaping not only what information is accessed but how questions are framed, how evidence is interpreted, and when action feels warranted. Here we propose a framework for sustained human-AI interaction that rests on invariant features of human cognition and human--AI interaction and centers on three interlinked phenomena: entanglement between users and AI systems, the emergence of cognitive and behavioral drift over repeated interactions, and the role of metacognition in the awareness and regulation of these dynamics. As conversational agents provide cues (e.g., fluency, coherence, responsiveness) that people treat as informative, subjective confidence and action readiness may increase without corresponding gains in epistemic reliability, making drift difficult to detect and correct. We describe these dynamics across micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. The framework identifies four metacognitive intervention points and psychologically informed interventions that provide metacognitive scaffolding (boosting and self-nudging). Finally, we outline a long-horizon research agenda for scientific foresight.",

In this work, we address the off-policy problem in a zero-shot setting by discovering a theoretical connection of successor measures to stationary density ratios. Using this insight, our algorithm can infer optimal importance sampling ratios, effectively performing a stationary distribution correction with an optimal policy for any task on the fly. We benchmark our method in motion tracking tasks on SMPL Humanoid, continuous control on ExoRL, and for the long-horizon OGBench tasks.

Existing attempts to bridge this gap primarily rely on retrieving successful past trajectories as demonstrations. However, this paradigm faces two critical limitations. First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters. This enables the agent to internalize extensive historical experience directly into its latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method in long-term agent evolution.",

We introduce Moe-Ctc, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with intermediate CTC supervision that jointly promotes expert specialization and generalization. During training, accent-aware routing encourages experts to capture accent-specific patterns, which gradually transitions to label-free routing for inference. Each expert is equipped with its own CTC head to align routing with transcription quality, and a routing-augmented loss further stabilizes optimization. Experiments on the Mcv-Accent benchmark demonstrate consistent gains across both seen and unseen accents in low- and high-resource conditions, achieving up to 29.3% relative WER reduction over strong FastConformer baselines.",

To address these issues, we propose IntraSlice, a framework that applies block-wise module-intra PCA compression pruning. By leveraging the structural characteristics of Transformer modules, we design an approximate PCA method whose transformation matrices can be fully fused into the model without additional parameters. We also introduce a PCA-based global pruning ratio estimator that further considers the distribution of compressed activations, building on conventional module importance. We validate our method on Llama2, Llama3, and Phi series across various language benchmarks.

To explore this, our study presents a self-sampling framework based on activation steering for efficient CoT learning. Our method can induce style-aligned and variable-length reasoning traces from target LLMs themselves without any teacher guidance, thereby alleviating a central bottleneck of SFT-based methods-the scarcity of high-quality supervision data. Using filtered data by gold answers, we perform SFT for efficient CoT learning with (i) a human-like dual-cognitive system, and (ii) a progressive compression curriculum. Furthermore, we explore a self-evolution regime in which SFT is driven solely by prediction-consistent data of variable-length variants, eliminating the need for gold answers.

Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction.

Understanding how such beliefs transfer across tasks and shape delegation is therefore critical for the design of multipurpose AI systems. We report a preregistered experiment (N=240; 7,200 trials) in which participants interacted with a controlled AI simulation across grammar checking, travel planning, and visual question answering, each with fixed, domain-typical accuracy levels. Delegation was operationalized as a binary reliance decision: accepting the AI's output versus acting independently, and belief dynamics were evaluated against Bayesian benchmarks. We find three main results. First, participants do not reset beliefs between tasks: priors in a new task depend on posteriors from the previous task, with a 10-point increase predicting a 3-4 point higher subsequent prior. Second, within tasks, belief updating follows the Bayesian direction but is substantially conservative, proceeding at roughly half the normative Bayesian rate. Third, delegation is driven primarily by subjective beliefs about AI accuracy rather than self-confidence, though confidence independently reduces reliance when beliefs are held constant. Together, these findings show that users form global, path-dependent expectations about multipurpose AI systems, update them conservatively, and rely on AI primarily based on subjective beliefs rather than objective performance. We discuss implications for expectation calibration, reliance design, and the risks of belief spillovers in deployed LLM-based interfaces.",

For example, a grounding query that previously activated localization experts may instead be routed to irrelevant experts after learning OCR tasks. Meanwhile, the grounding-related experts can be overwritten by new tasks and lose their original functionality. Such failure reflects two problems: router drift, where expert selection becomes inconsistent over time, and expert drift, where shared experts are overwritten across tasks. Therefore, we propose StAbilized Mixture-of-Experts (SAME) for MCIT. To address router drift, SAME stabilizes expert selection by decomposing routing dynamics into orthogonal subspaces and updating only task-relevant directions. To mitigate expert drift, we regulate expert updates via curvature-aware scaling using historical input covariance in a rehearsal-free manner. SAME also introduces adaptive expert activation to freeze selected experts during training, reducing redundant computation and cross-task interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate its SOTA performance.",

However, attempting to achieve detailed control to get a desired image solely through text remains a laborious trial-and-error endeavor. Recent methods have introduced image-level controls alongside with text prompts, using prior images to extract conditional information such as edges, segmentation and depth maps. While effective, these methods apply conditions uniformly across the entire image, limiting localized control. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enable precise local control over user-defined regions of an image, while leaving to the diffusion model the task of autonomously generating the remaining areas according to the original prompt. Our approach introduces a new training framework that incorporates masking features and an additional loss term, which leverages the prediction of the initial latent vector at any diffusion step to enhance the correspondence between the current step and the final sample in the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively synthesizes high-quality images with controlled local conditions.",

Despite its central role in cognition, the mechanisms by which Transformers acquire and implement analogical reasoning remain poorly understood. In this work, inspired by the notion of functors in category theory, we formalize analogical reasoning as the inference of correspondences between entities across categories. Based on this formulation, we introduce synthetic tasks that evaluate the emergence of analogical reasoning under controlled settings. We find that the emergence of analogical reasoning is highly sensitive to data characteristics, optimization choices, and model scale. Through mechanistic analysis, we show that analogical reasoning in Transformers decomposes into two key components: (1) geometric alignment of relational structure in the embedding space, and (2) the application of a functor within the Transformer. These mechanisms enable models to transfer relational structure from one category to another, realizing analogy. Finally, we quantify these effects and find that the same trends are observed in pretrained LLMs. In doing so, we move analogy from an abstract cognitive notion to a concrete, mechanistically grounded phenomenon in modern neural networks.",

However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks. Through a systematic study across multiple model families, we find that tasks requiring multi-step reasoning are particularly sensitive to depth reduction. Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate a simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90\\% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20--30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques. Crucially, despite these gains, recovery for generative reasoning remains fundamentally limited relative to classification tasks and is viable primarily at lower pruning ratios. Overall, we characterize the practical limits of layer pruning for generative reasoning and provide guidance on when depth reduction can be applied effectively under constrained post-training regimes.",

To bridge this gap, we anchor on the onset of reflection behavior and trace its layer-wise activation trajectory. Using the logit lens to read out token-level semantics, we uncover a structured progression: (i) Latent-control layers, where an approximate linear direction encodes the semantics of thinking budget; (ii) Semantic-pivot layers, where discourse-level cues, including turning-point and summarization cues, surface and dominate the probability mass; and (iii) Behavior-overt layers, where the likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens begins to rise until they become highly likely to be sampled. Moreover, our targeted interventions uncover a causal chain across these stages: prompt-level semantics modulate the projection of activations along latent-control directions, thereby inducing competition between turning-point and summarization cues in semantic-pivot layers, which in turn regulates the sampling likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens in behavior-overt layers. Collectively, our findings suggest a human-like meta-cognitive process-progressing from latent monitoring, to discourse-level regulation, and to finally overt self-reflection.

Recent approaches leverage generalizable models to generate 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) primitive. However, they often fail to produce continuous surfaces and instead yield discrete, color-biased point clouds that appear plausible at normal resolution but reveal severe artifacts under close-up views. To address this issue, we present SurfSplat, a feedforward framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitive, which provides stronger anisotropy and higher geometric precision. By incorporating a surface continuity prior and a forced alpha blending strategy, SurfSplat reconstructs coherent geometry together with faithful textures. Furthermore, we introduce High-Resolution Rendering Consistency (HRRC), a new evaluation metric designed to evaluate high-resolution reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

We propose Structured Residual Reconstruction (SRR), a rank-allocation framework that preserves the top-$k$ singular subspace of the activation-scaled weight before quantization, quantizes only the residual, and uses the remaining rank $r-k$ for error reconstruction. We derive a theory-guided criterion for selecting $k$ by balancing quantization-exposed energy and unrecoverable error under rank constraints.

Our framework introduces a LiDAR-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to encode input LiDAR sequences, alongside a video VAE for multi-camera images. To ensure cross-modal compatibility and training stability, we propose Unified Latent Anchoring (ULA), which explicitly aligns the latent distributions of the two modalities. The aligned features are fused and processed by a diffusion transformer that jointly models their geometric correspondence and temporal evolution. Additionally, structured scene layout information is projected per modality as a conditioning signal to guide the synthesis.

RAG targets large, heterogeneous corpora where retrieved passages are diverse, whereas agent memory is a bounded, coherent dialogue stream with highly correlated spans that are often duplicates. Under this shift, fixed top-$k$ similarity retrieval tends to return redundant context, and post-hoc pruning can delete temporally linked prerequisites needed for correct reasoning. We argue retrieval should move beyond similarity matching and instead operate over latent components, following decoupling to aggregation: disentangle memories into semantic components, organise them into a hierarchy, and use this structure to drive retrieval. We propose xMemory, which builds a hierarchy of intact units and maintains a searchable yet faithful high-level node organisation via a sparsity--semantics objective that guides memory split and merge. At inference, xMemory retrieves top-down, selecting a compact, diverse set of themes and semantics for multi-fact queries, and expanding to episodes and raw messages only when it reduces the reader's uncertainty. Experiments on LoCoMo and PerLTQA across the three latest LLMs show consistent gains in answer quality and token efficiency.",

We propose Logic-Guided Vector Fields (LGVF), a neuro-symbolic framework that injects symbolic knowledge, specified as differentiable relaxations of logical constraints, into flow matching generative models. LGVF couples two complementary mechanisms: (1) a training-time logic loss that penalizes constraint violations along continuous flow trajectories, with weights that emphasize correctness near the target distribution; and (2) an inference-time adjustment that steers sampling using constraint gradients, acting as a lightweight, logic-informed correction to the learned dynamics. We evaluate LGVF on three constrained generation case studies spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-region feasibility constraints. Across all settings, LGVF reduces constraint violations by 59-82% compared to standard flow matching and achieves the lowest violation rates in each case. In the linear and ring settings, LGVF also improves distributional fidelity as measured by MMD, while in the multi-obstacle setting, we observe a satisfaction-fidelity trade-off, with improved feasibility but increased MMD. Beyond quantitative gains, LGVF yields constraint-aware vector fields exhibiting emergent obstacle-avoidance behavior, routing samples around forbidden regions without explicit path planning.",

VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guide the model to produce an initial answer, generate and answer a probing verification query, issue a consistency judgment, and then decide whether to answer or abstain. To address the risk of reinforcing hallucinated content when training on augmented traces, we introduce a stage-level loss masking approach that excludes hallucinated answer stages from the training objective while preserving supervision over verification behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, VeriFY reduces factual hallucination rates by 9.7 to 53.3 percent, with only modest reductions in recall (0.4 to 5.7 percent), and generalizes across datasets when trained on a single source.

Feature augmentation enriches a base table by discovering and integrating features from related tables through join operations. However, scaling this process to complex schemas with many tables and multi-hop paths remains challenging. Feature augmentation must address three core tasks: identify promising join paths that connect the base table to candidate tables, execute these joins to materialize augmented data, and select the most informative features from the results. Existing approaches face a fundamental tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency: achieving high accuracy requires exploring many candidate paths, but exhaustive exploration is computationally prohibitive. Some methods compromise by considering only immediate neighbors, limiting their effectiveness, while others employ neural models that require expensive training data and introduce scalability limitations. We present Hippasus, a modular framework that achieves both goals through three key contributions. First, we combine lightweight statistical signals with semantic reasoning from Large Language Models to prune unpromising join paths before execution, focusing computational resources on high-quality candidates. Second, we employ optimized multi-way join algorithms and consolidate features from multiple paths, substantially reducing execution time. Third, we integrate LLM-based semantic understanding with statistical measures to select features that are both semantically meaningful and empirically predictive. Our experimental evaluation on publicly available datasets shows that Hippasus substantially improves feature augmentation accuracy by up to 26.8% over state-of-the-art baselines while also offering high runtime performance.",

Existing knowledge editing approaches emphasize atomic facts, improving factual recall but often failing to integrate new information into a coherent framework usable across contexts. In this work, we argue that knowledge internalization is fundamentally a reasoning problem rather than a memorization problem. Consequently, a model should be trained in situations where the new information is instrumental to solving a task, combined with pre-existing knowledge, and exercised through multi-step reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose a training strategy based on three principles. First, new knowledge is introduced as a coherent background story that contextualizes novel facts and explains their relation to existing knowledge. Second, models are trained using self-generated multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning involving the new information. Third, training is done using knowledge distillation, forcing a student model to internalize the teacher's reasoning behavior without access to the novel information. Experiments show that models trained with this strategy effectively leverage newly acquired knowledge during reasoning and achieve remarkable performance on challenging questions that require combining multiple new facts.",

CIR encodes the semantics of operational rules through constraint archetypes and candidate modeling paradigms, thereby decoupling rule logic from its mathematical instantiation. Upon a newly generated CIR knowledge base, we develop the rule-to-constraint (R2C) framework, a multi-agent pipeline that parses problem texts, synthesizes CIR implementations by retrieving domain knowledge, and instantiates optimization models. To systematically evaluate rule-to-constraint reasoning, we test R2C on our newly constructed benchmark featuring rich operational rules, and benchmarks from prior work. Extensive experiments show that R2C achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the proposed benchmark (47.2% Accuracy Rate). On established benchmarks from the literature, R2C delivers highly competitive results, approaching the performance of proprietary models (e.g., GPT-5). Moreover, with a reflection mechanism, R2C achieves further gains and sets new best-reported results on some benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Advertising image generation has increasingly focused on online metrics like Click-Through Rate (CTR), yet existing approaches adopt a ``one-size-fits-all\" strategy that optimizes for overall CTR while neglecting preference diversity among user groups. This leads to suboptimal performance for specific groups, limiting targeted marketing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we present \\textit{One Size, Many Fits} (OSMF), a unified framework that aligns diverse group-wise click preferences in large-scale advertising image generation. OSMF begins with product-aware adaptive grouping, which dynamically organizes users based on their attributes and product characteristics, representing each group with rich collective preference features. Building on these groups, preference-conditioned image generation employs a Group-aware Multimodal Large Language Model (G-MLLM) to generate tailored images for each group. The G-MLLM is pre-trained to simultaneously comprehend group features and generate advertising images. Subsequently, we fine-tune the G-MLLM using our proposed Group-DPO for group-wise preference alignment, which effectively enhances each group's CTR on the generated images. To further advance this field, we introduce the Grouped Advertising Image Preference Dataset (GAIP), the first large-scale public dataset of group-wise image preferences, including around 600K groups built from 40M users. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both offline and online settings.

However, many agentic architectures rely primarily on prompt engineering of a single agent, making it difficult to observe or compare how models handle uncertainty and coordination across interconnected decision stages and with human oversight. We introduce a multi-agent system formalized as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a directed acyclic structure. Each agent corresponds to a specific role or decision stage (e.g., content, business, or legal review in a compliance workflow), with predefined transitions representing task escalation or completion. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified at the agent level using Monte Carlo estimation, while system-level uncertainty is captured by the MDP's termination in either an automated labeled state or a human-review state. We illustrate the approach through a case study in AI safety evaluation for self-harm detection, implemented as a multi-agent compliance system. Results demonstrate improvements over a single-agent baseline, including up to a 19\\% increase in accuracy, up to an 85x reduction in required human review, and, in some configurations, reduced processing time.",

In this paper, we introduce a frictional-contact pipeline for implicit MPM that is both precise and robust. During the collision detection phase, contact points are localized with particle-centric geometric primitives; during the contact resolution phase, we cast frictional contact as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP) over contact impulses and solve it with an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) scheme. Crucially, the formulation reuses the same implicit MPM linearization, yielding efficiency and numerical stability. The method integrates seamlessly into the implicit MPM loop and is agnostic to modeling choices, including material laws, interpolation functions, and transfer schemes. We evaluate it across seven representative scenes that span elastic and elasto-plastic responses, simple and complex deformable geometries, and a wide range of contact conditions. Overall, the proposed method enables accurate contact localization, reliable frictional handling, and broad generality, making it a practical solution for MPM-based simulations in robotics and related domains.",

Disentangling the visual and linguistic roots of these failures is a fundamental challenge for robust evaluation. To enable fine-grained, controllable analysis, we introduce Auto-Comp, a fully automated and synthetic pipeline for generating scalable benchmarks. Its controllable nature is key to dissecting and isolating different reasoning skills. Auto-Comp generates paired images from Minimal (e.g., \"a monitor to the left of a bicycle on a white background\") and LLM-generated Contextual captions (e.g., \"In a brightly lit photography studio, a monitor is positioned to the left of a bicycle\"), allowing a controlled A/B test to disentangle core binding ability from visio-linguistic complexity. Our evaluation of 20 VLMs on novel benchmarks for color binding and spatial relations reveals universal compositional failures in both CLIP and SigLIP model families. Crucially, our novel \"Confusion Benchmark\" reveals a deeper flaw beyond simple attribute swaps: models are highly susceptible to low-entropy distractors (e.g., repeated objects or colors), demonstrating their compositional failures extend beyond known bag-of-words limitations. we uncover a surprising trade-off: visio-linguistic context, which provides global scene cues, aids spatial reasoning but simultaneously hinders local attribute binding by introducing visual clutter.

While NVFP4 mitigates quantization error via hierarchical microscaling, a persistent loss gap remains compared to BF16. This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of outlier dynamics across architecture during NVFP4 pretraining, focusing on where they localize, why they occur, and how they evolve temporally. We find that, compared with Softmax Attention (SA), Linear Attention (LA) reduces per-tensor heavy tails but still exhibits persistent block-level spikes under block quantization. Our analysis attributes outliers to specific architectural components: Softmax in SA, gating in LA, and SwiGLU in FFN, with \"post-QK\" operations exhibiting higher sensitivity to quantization. Notably, outliers evolve from transient spikes early in training to a small set of persistent hot channels (i.e., channels with persistently large magnitudes) in later stages. Based on these findings, we introduce Hot-Channel Patch (HCP), an online compensation mechanism that identifies hot channels and reinjects residuals using hardware-efficient kernels. We then develop CHON, an NVFP4 training recipe integrating HCP with post-QK operation protection. On GLA-1.3B model trained for 60B tokens, CHON reduces the loss gap to BF16 from 0.94% to 0.58% while maintaining downstream accuracy.",

Building on this finding, we propose using entropy reduction as a supervisory signal and design two reward strategies to address the differing needs of optimizing tool-use behavior. Sparse outcome rewards provide coarse, trajectory-level guidance to improve efficiency, while dense process rewards offer fine-grained supervision to enhance performance. Experiments across diverse domains show that both reward designs improve tool-use behavior: the former reduces tool calls by 72.07% compared to the average of baselines, while the latter improves performance by 22.27%.

Offline RL tends to get stuck in local optima, and in FRL, one device's suboptimal policy can degrade the aggregated model, i.e., policy pollution. We present FORLER, combining Q-ensemble aggregation on the server with actor rectification on devices. The server robustly merges device Q-functions to curb policy pollution and shift heavy computation off resource-constrained hardware without compromising privacy. Locally, actor rectification enriches policy gradients via a zeroth-order search for high-Q actions plus a bespoke regularizer that nudges the policy toward them.

We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions. Across text--image and audio--visual benchmarks, we show that instruction-conditioned gating induces consistent and causal shifts in internal computation, selectively amplifying or suppressing core and spurious feature groups without modifying the label space or training objective. Further analyses demonstrate that FiLoRA yields improved robustness under spurious feature interventions, revealing a principled mechanism to regulate reliance beyond correlation-driven learning.",

Several online algorithms are being deployed, but they overlook the following two key challenges inherent to conversational LLM services: (1) unsatisfied users may retry queries, increasing the server backlog, and (2) requests for ``explicit\" feedback, such as ratings, degrade user experiences. In this paper, we develop a joint routing and scheduling algorithm that leverages ``implicit\" feedback inferred from user retrial behaviors. The key idea is to propose and study the framework of contextual queueing bandits with multinomial logit feedback (CQB-MNL). CQB-MNL models query retrials, as well as context-based learning for user preferences over LLMs. Our algorithm, anytime CQB (ACQB), achieves efficient learning while maintaining queue stability by combining Thompson sampling with forced exploration at a decaying rate. We show that ACQB simultaneously achieves a cumulative regret of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{t})$ for routing and a queue length regret of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/4})$ for any large $t$.

We present See2Refine, a human-free, closed-loop framework that uses vision-language model (VLM) perceptual evaluation as automated visual feedback to improve an LLM-based eHMI action designer. Given a driving context and a candidate eHMI action, the VLM evaluates the perceived appropriateness of the action, and this feedback is used to iteratively revise the designer's outputs, enabling systematic refinement without human supervision. We evaluate our framework across three eHMI modalities (lightbar, eyes, and arm) and multiple LLM model sizes. Across settings, our framework consistently outperforms prompt-only LLM designers and manually specified baselines in both VLM-based metrics and human-subject evaluations. Results further indicate that the improvements generalize across modalities and that VLM evaluations are well aligned with human preferences, supporting the robustness and effectiveness of See2Refine for scalable action design.",

This bottleneck stems from two hardware limitations: (1) limited data bandwidth between matrix and vector compute cores, and (2) the significant area cost of high-precision (FP32/16) exponentiation units (EXP2). To address these issues, we introduce a novel low-precision workflow that employs a specific 8-bit floating-point format (HiF8) and block-aware precision rescaling for softmax. Crucially, our algorithmic innovations make low-precision softmax feasible without the significant model accuracy loss that hampers direct low-precision approaches. Specifically, our design (i) halves the required data movement bandwidth by enabling matrix multiplication outputs constrained to 8-bit, and (ii) substantially reduces the EXP2 unit area by computing exponentiations in low (8-bit) precision. Extensive evaluation on language models and multi-modal models confirms the validity of our method. By alleviating the vector computation bottleneck, our work paves the way for doubling end-to-end inference throughput without increasing chip area, and offers a concrete co-design path for future low-precision hardware and software.",

To address these issues, we present UrbanGS, a scalable reconstruction framework that effectively tackles these challenges for city-scale applications. First, we propose a Depth-Consistent D-Normal Regularization module. Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on monocular normal estimators, which can effectively update rotation parameters yet struggle to update position parameters, our method integrates D-Normal constraints with external depth supervision. This allows for comprehensive updates of all geometric parameters. By further incorporating an adaptive confidence weighting mechanism based on gradient consistency and inverse depth deviation, our approach significantly enhances multi-view depth alignment and geometric coherence, which effectively resolves the issue of geometric accuracy in complex large-scale scenes. To improve scalability, we introduce a Spatially Adaptive Gaussian Pruning (SAGP) strategy, which dynamically adjusts Gaussian density based on local geometric complexity and visibility to reduce redundancy. Additionally, a unified partitioning and view assignment scheme is designed to eliminate boundary artifacts and optimize computational load. Extensive experiments on multiple urban datasets demonstrate that UrbanGS achieves superior performance in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and memory efficiency, providing a systematic solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.",

The main focus is on multidimensional convex limiting techniques designed to constrain antidiffusive element contributions rather than fluxes. We show that the resulting schemes can be interpreted as residual distribution methods. Two kinds of convex limiting can be used to enforce the validity of generalized discrete maximum principles in this context. The first approach has the structure of a localized flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm, in which the computation of a low-order predictor is followed by an antidiffusive correction stage. The second option is the use of a monolithic convex limiting (MCL) procedure at the level of spatial semi-discretization. In both cases, inequality constraints are imposed on scalar functions of intermediate states that are required to stay in convex invariant sets.",

Moreover, naive length penalties in group-relative optimization can severely hurt accuracy. We attribute this failure to two structural issues: (i) Dilution of Length Baseline, where incorrect responses (with zero length reward) depress the group baseline and over-penalize correct solutions; and (ii) Difficulty-Penalty Mismatch, where a static penalty cannot adapt to problem difficulty, suppressing necessary reasoning on hard instances while leaving redundancy on easy ones. We propose Dynamic Decoupled Conditional Advantage (DDCA) to decouple efficiency optimization from correctness. DDCA computes length advantages conditionally within the correct-response cluster to eliminate baseline dilution, and dynamically scales the penalty strength using the group pass rate as a proxy for difficulty. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, AMC23, and AIME25 show that DDCA consistently improves the efficiency--accuracy trade-off relative to adaptive baselines, reducing generated tokens by approximately 60% on simpler tasks (e.g., GSM8K) versus over 20% on harder benchmarks (e.g., AIME25), thereby maintaining or improving accuracy.

To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning.

We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation.

The primary culprits are the activations, whose memory footprints scale linearly with sequence length. We introduce OOMB, a highly memory-efficient training system that directly confronts this barrier. Our approach employs a chunk-recurrent training framework with on-the-fly activation recomputation, which maintains a constant activation memory footprint (O(1)) and shifts the primary bottleneck to the growing KV cache. To manage the KV cache, OOMB integrates a suite of synergistic optimizations: a paged memory manager for both the KV cache and its gradients to eliminate fragmentation, asynchronous CPU offloading to hide data transfer latency, and page-level sparse attention to reduce both computational complexity and communication overhead. The synergy of these techniques yields exceptional efficiency. Our empirical results show that for every additional 10K tokens of context, the end-to-end training memory overhead increases by a mere 10MB for Qwen2.5-7B. This allows training Qwen2.5-7B with a 4M-token context on a single H200 GPU, a feat that would otherwise require a large cluster using context parallelism.

Motivated by this, we propose order-expressive masked diffusion model (OeMDM) for a broad class of diffusion generative processes with various generation orders, enabling the interpretation of MDM, ARM, and block diffusion in a single framework. Furthermore, building on OeMDM, we introduce learnable-order masked diffusion model (LoMDM), which jointly learns the generation ordering and diffusion backbone through a single objective from scratch, enabling the diffusion model to generate text in context-dependent ordering.

        "abstract": "We propose MLV-Edit, a training-free, flow-based framework that address the unique challenges of minute-level video editing. While existing techniques excel in short-form video manipulation, scaling them to long-duration videos remains challenging due to prohibitive computational overhead and the difficulty of maintaining global temporal consistency across thousands of frames. To address this, MLV-Edit employs a divide-and-conquer strategy for segment-wise editing, facilitated by two core modules: Velocity Blend rectifies motion inconsistencies at segment boundaries by aligning the flow fields of adjacent chunks, eliminating flickering and boundary artifacts commonly observed in fragmented video processing; and Attention Sink anchors local segment features to global reference frames, effectively suppressing cumulative structural drift. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MLV-Edit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of temporal stability and semantic fidelity.",

Among existing methods, GPTQ has been widely adopted due to its efficiency; however, it neglects input statistics and inter-group correlations when determining group scales, leading to a mismatch with its goal of minimizing layer-wise reconstruction loss. In this work, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for group scales that explicitly minimizes the layer-wise reconstruction loss. In the first stage, performed prior to GPTQ, we initialize each group scale to minimize the group-wise reconstruction loss, thereby incorporating input statistics. In the second stage, we freeze the integer weights obtained via GPTQ and refine the group scales to minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss. To this end, we employ the coordinate descent algorithm and derive a closed-form update rule, which enables efficient refinement without costly numerical optimization. Notably, our derivation incorporates the quantization errors from preceding layers to prevent error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently enhances group-wise quantization, achieving higher accuracy with negligible overhead.",

The primary effect of different directions is not whether the model refuses, but how it refuses.",

Masked diffusion-based language models (MDMs) exhibit this failure in a much weaker form, but the underlying reason has remained unclear. A common explanation attributes this mitigation to the any-order training objective. However, observing \"[MASK] is $B$\" during training does not necessarily teach the model to handle the reverse prompt \"$B$ is [MASK]\". We show that the mitigation arises from architectural structure and its interaction with training. In a one-layer Transformer encoder, weight sharing couples the two directions by making forward and reverse attention scores positively correlated. In the same setting, we further show that the corresponding gradients are aligned, so minimizing the forward loss also reduces the reverse loss. Experiments on both controlled toy tasks and large-scale diffusion language models support these mechanisms, explaining why MDMs partially overcome a failure mode that persists in strong ARMs.",

Existing datasets used for safety alignment for an LRM are usually constructed by distilling safety reasoning traces and answers from an external LRM or human labeler. However, such reasoning traces and answers exhibit a distributional gap with the target LRM that needs alignment, and we conjecture such distributional gap is the culprit leading to significant degradation of reasoning ability of the target LRM. Driven by this hypothesis, we propose a safety alignment dataset construction method, dubbed DGR. DGR transforms and refines an existing out-of-distributional safety reasoning dataset to be aligned with the target's LLM inner distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that i) DGR effectively mitigates the safety tax while maintaining safety performance across all baselines, i.e., achieving \\textbf{+30.2\\%} on DirectRefusal and \\textbf{+21.2\\%} on R1-ACT improvement in average reasoning accuracy compared to Vanilla SFT; ii) the degree of reasoning degradation correlates with the extent of distribution shift, suggesting that bridging this gap is central to preserving capabilities. Furthermore, we find that safety alignment in LRMs may primarily function as a mechanism to activate latent knowledge, as a mere \\textbf{10} samples are sufficient for activating effective refusal behaviors. These findings not only emphasize the importance of distributional consistency but also provide insights into the activation mechanism of safety in reasoning models.",

However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence.",

We further demonstrate CAM's practical utility through two applications: (1) failure repair which achieves a 73.3\\% success rate by optimizing top-3 importance-ranked features and (2) feature pruning that reduces up to 66.8\\% intermediate token consumption while maintaining generation performance.

We present Force-Distilled VLA (FD-VLA), a novel framework that integrates force awareness into contact-rich manipulation without relying on physical force sensors. The core of our approach is a Force Distillation Module (FDM), which distills force by mapping a learnable query token, conditioned on visual observations and robot states, into a predicted force token aligned with the latent representation of actual force signals. During inference, this distilled force token is injected into the pretrained VLM, enabling force-aware reasoning while preserving the integrity of its vision-language semantics. This design provides two key benefits: first, it allows practical deployment across a wide range of robots that lack expensive or fragile force-torque sensors, thereby reducing hardware cost and complexity; second, the FDM introduces an additional force-vision-state fusion prior to the VLM, which improves cross-modal alignment and enhances perception-action robustness in contact-rich scenarios. Surprisingly, our physical experiments show that the distilled force token outperforms direct sensor force measurements as well as other baselines, which highlights the effectiveness of this force-distilled VLA approach.",

To this end, we synthesize selection tasks from large-scale math and code instruction datasets by filtering to instances with both correct and incorrect candidate solutions, and train 1.7B-parameter models with DAPO to reward correct selections. Across math (AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25) and code (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks, our models consistently outperform prompting and majority-voting baselines, often approaching or exceeding much larger models. Moreover, these gains generalize to selecting outputs from stronger models despite training only on outputs from weaker models. Overall, our results establish reinforcement learning as a scalable way to unlock strong generative selection in small models, enabling efficient test-time scaling.",

To reduce overhead and improve exploration, prior work introduces tree structured rollouts, which share reasoning prefixes and branch at key nodes to improve sampling efficiency. However, this paradigm still faces two challenges: (1) high entropy branching can trigger rollout collapse, where the branching budget concentrates on a few trajectories with consecutive high-entropy segments, rapidly reducing the number of effective branches; (2) early pseudo-labels are noisy and biased, which can induce self-reinforcing overfitting, causing the policy to sharpen prematurely and suppress exploration. To address these issues, we propose Entropy Confidence Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (ECHO). During rollout, ECHO jointly leverages local entropy and group level confidence to adaptively control branch width, and further introduces online confidence-based pruning to terminate persistently low confidence branches, avoiding high entropy traps and mitigating collapse. During policy updates, ECHO employs confidence adaptive clipping and an entropy confidence hybrid advantage shaping approach to enhance training robustness and mitigate early stage bias. Experiments demonstrate that ECHO achieves consistent gains on multiple mathematical and visual reasoning benchmarks, and generalizes more effectively under a limited rollout budget.",

Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Qwen3 models demonstrate that VQRound achieves better convergence than traditional adaptive rounding at the same number of steps while using as little as 0.2% of the trainable parameters.

However, we argue that the feed-forward architecture, where computational depth is strictly bound to parameter size, falls short of capturing the iterative, algorithmic nature of human induction. In this work, we propose a recursive architecture called Loop-ViT, which decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence. Loop-ViT iterates a weight-tied Hybrid Block, combining local convolutions and global attention, to form a latent chain of thought. Crucially, we introduce a parameter-free Dynamic Exit mechanism based on predictive entropy: the model halts inference when its internal state ``crystallizes\" into a low-uncertainty attractor. Empirical results on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark validate this perspective: our 18M model achieves 65.8% accuracy, outperforming massive 73M-parameter ensembles. These findings demonstrate that adaptive iterative computation offers a far more efficient scaling axis for visual reasoning than simply increasing network width.

In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference.

We propose Co-RedTeam, a security-aware multi-agent framework designed to mirror real-world red-teaming workflows by integrating security-domain knowledge, code-aware analysis, execution-grounded iterative reasoning, and long-term memory. Co-RedTeam decomposes vulnerability analysis into coordinated discovery and exploitation stages, enabling agents to plan, execute, validate, and refine actions based on real execution feedback while learning from prior trajectories. Extensive evaluations on challenging security benchmarks demonstrate that Co-RedTeam consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse backbone models, achieving over 60% success rate in vulnerability exploitation and over 10% absolute improvement in vulnerability detection. Ablation and iteration studies further confirm the critical role of execution feedback, structured interaction, and memory for building robust and generalizable cybersecurity agents.",

Existing methods generate images with insufficient diversity and controllability, suffering from issues such as monotonous texture features and distorted anatomical structures. Therefore, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network (TSGAN) to enhance the diversity and spatial controllability of synthetic data by decoupling the morphological structure and texture features of lung nodules. In the first stage, StyleGAN is used to generate semantic segmentation mask images, encoding lung nodules and tissue backgrounds to control the anatomical structure of lung nodule images; The second stage uses the DL-Pix2Pix model to translate the mask map into CT images, employing local importance attention to capture local features, while utilizing dynamic weight multi-head window attention to enhance the modeling capability of lung nodule texture and background. Compared to the original dataset, the accuracy improved by 4.6% and mAP by 4% on the LUNA16 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that TSGAN can enhance the quality of synthetic images and the performance of detection models.",

We reveal that DLLMs can effectively absorb alignment knowledge from AR-LLMs through simple weight scaling, exploiting the shared architectural structure between these divergent generation paradigms. Crucially, our approach circumvents the high variance and computational overhead of direct DLLM alignment and comprehensive experiments across diverse preference alignment tasks demonstrate that AR-MAP achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing DLLM-specific alignment methods, achieving 69.08\\% average score across all tasks and models.

Existing methods perform token routing based on sliding-window partitions, resulting in position-based selection and fails to capture token-specific global importance. Meanwhile, linear attention further suffers from distribution shift caused by learnable feature maps that distort pretrained feature magnitudes. Motivated by these limitations, we propose STILL, an intra-layer hybrid linearization framework for efficiently linearizing LLMs. STILL introduces a Self-Saliency Score with strong local-global consistency, enabling accurate token selection using sliding-window computation, and retains salient tokens for sparse softmax attention while summarizing the remaining context via linear attention. To preserve pretrained representations, we design a Norm-Preserved Feature Map (NP-Map) that decouples feature direction from magnitude and reinjects pretrained norms. We further adopt a unified training-inference architecture with chunk-wise parallelization and delayed selection to improve hardware efficiency. Experiments show that STILL matches or surpasses the original pretrained model on commonsense and general reasoning tasks, and achieves up to a 86.2% relative improvement over prior linearized attention methods on long-context benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Powered prostheses are capable of providing net positive work to amputees and have advanced in the past two decades. However, reducing amputee metabolic cost of walking remains an open problem. The Law of Intersegmental Coordination (ISC) has been observed across gaits and has been previously implicated in energy expenditure of walking, yet it has rarely been analyzed or applied within the context of lower-limb amputee gait. This law states that the elevation angles of the thigh, shank and foot over the gait cycle are not independent. In this work, we developed a method to analyze intersegmental coordination for lower-limb 3D kinematic data, to simplify ISC analysis. Moreover, inspired by motor control, biomechanics and robotics literature, we used our method to broaden ISC toward a new law of coordination of moments. We find these Elevation Space Moments (ESM), and present results showing a moment-based coordination for able bodied gait. We also analyzed ISC for amputee gait walking with powered and passive prosthesis, and found that while elevation angles remained planar, the ESM showed less coordination. We use ISC as a constraint to predict the shank angles/moments that would compensate for alterations due to a passive foot so as to mimic a healthy thigh angle/moment profile. This may have implications for improving powered prosthetic control. We developed the ISC3d toolbox that is freely available online, which may be used to compute kinematic and kinetic ISC in 3D. This provides a means to further study the role of coordination in gait and may help address fundamental questions of the neural control of human movement.",

Existing linguistic benchmarks typically focus on narrow phenomena, emphasize high-resource languages, and rarely evaluate metalinguistic knowledge-explicit reasoning about language structure rather than language use. Using accuracy and macro F1, together with majority-class and chance baselines, we analyse overall performance and examine variation by linguistic domains and language-related factors. Our results show that metalinguistic knowledge in current LLMs is limited: GPT-4o performs best but achieves only moderate accuracy (0.367), while open-source models lag behind. All models perform above chance but fail to outperform the majority-class baseline, suggesting they capture cross-linguistic patterns but lack fine-grained grammatical distinctions. Performance varies across linguistic domains, with lexical features showing the highest accuracy and phonological features among the lowest, partially reflecting differences in online visibility. At the language level, accuracy shows a strong association with digital language status: languages with higher digital presence and resource availability are evaluated more accurately, while low-resource languages show substantially lower performance. Analyses of predictive factors confirm that resource-related indicators (Wikipedia size, corpus availability) are more informative predictors of accuracy than geographical, genealogical, or sociolinguistic factors. Together, these results suggest that LLMs' metalinguistic knowledge is fragmented and shaped by data availability rather than generalizable grammatical competence across the world's languages. We release our benchmark as an open-source dataset to support systematic evaluation and encourage greater global linguistic diversity in future LLMs.",

However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow. This strategy is shown to effectively improve model performance in realistic visual retrieval scenarios. Overall, our results provide practical guidance for the design of future multimodal deep-research systems. The code will be released in https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-DeepResearch.",

We also observe systematic effects across the taxonomy: set-based tasks are relatively easy, whereas graph-structured problems and bottleneck objectives lead to more frequent failures.",

We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers.

We uncover a fundamental phenomenon termed State Rank Stratification, characterized by a distinct spectral bifurcation among linear attention heads: while one group maintains an effective rank oscillating near zero, the other exhibits rapid growth that converges to an upper bound. Extensive experiments across diverse inference contexts reveal that these dynamics remain strikingly consistent, indicating that the identity of a head,whether low-rank or high-rank,is an intrinsic structural property acquired during pre-training, rather than a transient state dependent on the input data. Furthermore, our diagnostic probes reveal a surprising functional divergence: low-rank heads are indispensable for model reasoning, whereas high-rank heads exhibit significant redundancy.

As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.",

Existing agent frameworks rely on rigid, syntax-heavy state representations such as nested JSON, which require models to devote a substantial portion of their limited attention to syntactic processing rather than semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose Fat-Cat, a document-driven agent architecture that improves the signal-to-noise ratio of state management. By integrating three key components: (1) a Semantic File System that represents agent state as Markdown documents aligned with common pre-training corpora, (2) a Textual Strategy Evolution module that accumulates task-solving knowledge without parameter updates, and (3) a Closed-Loop Watcher that monitors reasoning trajectories to reduce hallucinations. Extensive reasoning, retrieval, and coding benchmarks, Fat-Cat consistently improves agent performance. It enables the Kimi-k2 model to outperform the proprietary GPT-4o baseline on HotPotQA. Replacing the document-based state with JSON leads to performance drop, while empirically validating the critical necessity of document-driven state modeling over rigid syntax.

This paper presents AgriHubi, a domain-adapted retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for Finnish-language agricultural decision support. AgriHubi integrates Finnish agricultural documents with open PORO family models and combines explicit source grounding with user feedback to support iterative refinement. Developed over eight iterations and evaluated through two user studies, the system shows clear gains in answer completeness, linguistic accuracy, and perceived reliability. The results also reveal practical trade-offs between response quality and latency when deploying larger models.

However, existing approaches do not bridge this gap theoretically. They initialize the AR student via ODE distillation, which requires frame-level injectivity, where each noisy frame must map to a unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of an AR teacher. Distilling an AR student from a bidirectional teacher violates this condition, preventing recovery of the teacher's flow map and instead inducing a conditional-expectation solution, which degrades performance. To address this issue, we propose Causal Forcing that uses an AR teacher for ODE initialization, thereby bridging the architectural gap. Empirical results show that our method outperforms all baselines across all metrics, surpassing the SOTA Self Forcing by 19.3\\% in Dynamic Degree, 8.7\\% in VisionReward, and 16.7\\% in Instruction Following.

While prior works mainly focus on point-wise and pair-wise evaluation paradigms. Rubric-based evaluation, where LLMs select a score from multiple rubrics, has received less analysis. In this work, we show that rubric-based evaluation implicitly resembles a multi-choice setting and therefore has position bias: LLMs prefer score options appearing at specific positions in the rubric list. Through controlled experiments across multiple models and datasets, we demonstrate consistent position bias. To mitigate this bias, we propose a balanced permutation strategy that evenly distributes each score option across positions. We show that aggregating scores across balanced permutations not only reveals latent position bias, but also improves correlation between the LLM-as-a-Judge and human. Our results suggest that rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge is not inherently point-wise and that simple permutation-based calibration can substantially improve its reliability.",

Current reasoning-augmented paradigms most rely on explicit thought processes, where intermediate reasoning is decoded into discrete text at fixed steps with frequent image decoding and re-encoding, leading to inefficiencies, information loss, and cognitive mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce LatentMorph, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates implicit latent reasoning into the T2I generation process. At its core, LatentMorph introduces four lightweight components: (i) a condenser for summarizing intermediate generation states into compact visual memory, (ii) a translator for converting latent thoughts into actionable guidance, (iii) a shaper for dynamically steering next image token predictions, and (iv) an RL-trained invoker for adaptively determining when to invoke reasoning. By performing reasoning entirely in continuous latent spaces, LatentMorph avoids the bottlenecks of explicit reasoning and enables more adaptive self-refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentMorph (I) enhances the base model Janus-Pro by $16\\%$ on GenEval and $25\\%$ on T2I-CompBench; (II) outperforms explicit paradigms (e.g., TwiG) by $15\\%$ and $11\\%$ on abstract reasoning tasks like WISE and IPV-Txt, (III) while reducing inference time by $44\\%$ and token consumption by $51\\%$; and (IV) exhibits $71\\%$ cognitive alignment with human intuition on reasoning invocation.",

        "abstract": "Telemetry streams from large-scale Internet-connected systems (e.g., IoT deployments and online platforms) naturally form an irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) whose accurate forecasting is operationally vital. A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features. Experiments on public telemetry IMTS datasets show that SEDformer attains state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while reducing energy and memory usage, providing a natural and efficient path for modeling IMTS.",

Inspired by how human experts interpret spatial EEG patterns, TopoDiff incorporates topology-aware image embeddings derived from EEG topographic representations to provide global geometric context for spatial generation, together with a dynamic channel-relation graph that encodes inter-electrode relationships and evolves with temporal dynamics. This design yields a spatially grounded EEG spatial super-resolution framework with consistent performance improvements.

Adding entropy regularization during SFT is not a cure-all; it tends to flatten token distributions toward uniformity, increasing entropy without improving meaningful exploration capability. In this paper, we propose CurioSFT, an entropy-preserving SFT method designed to enhance exploration capabilities through intrinsic curiosity. It consists of (a) Self-Exploratory Distillation, which distills the model toward a self-generated, temperature-scaled teacher to encourage exploration within its capability; and (b) Entropy-Guided Temperature Selection, which adaptively adjusts distillation strength to mitigate knowledge forgetting by amplifying exploration at reasoning tokens while stabilizing factual tokens. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that, in SFT stage, CurioSFT outperforms the vanilla SFT by 2.5 points on in-distribution tasks and 2.9 points on out-of-distribution tasks. We also verify that exploration capabilities preserved during SFT successfully translate into concrete gains in RL stage, yielding an average improvement of 5.0 points.",

Failing to filter these distractors causes LAMs to capture spurious correlations and build sub-optimal latent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce MaskLAM -- a lightweight modification to LAM training to mitigate this issue by incorporating visual agent segmentation. MaskLAM utilises segmentation masks from pretrained foundation models to weight the LAM reconstruction loss, thereby prioritising salient information over background elements while requiring no architectural modifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on continuous-control MuJoCo tasks, modified with action-correlated background noise.

Strong theoretical results are known in this setting, achieving nearly-tight $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$-regret bounds. However, such detailed feedback can be unrealistic, and recent research has investigated more restricted settings such as trajectory feedback, where the agent observes all the visited state-action pairs, but only a single \\emph{aggregate} reward. In this paper, we consider a far more restrictive ``fully bandit'' feedback model for episodic MDPs, where the agent does not even observe the visited state-action pairs -- it only learns the aggregate reward. We provide the first efficient bandit learning algorithm for episodic MDPs with $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our regret has an exponential dependence on the horizon length $\\H$, which we show is necessary. We also obtain improved nearly-tight regret bounds for ``ordered'' MDPs; these can be used to model classical stochastic optimization problems such as $k$-item prophet inequality and sequential posted pricing. Finally, we evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm for the setting of $k$-item prophet inequalities; despite the highly restricted feedback, our algorithm's performance is comparable to that of a state-of-art learning algorithm (UCB-VI) with detailed state-action feedback.",

This raises a basic question: are CFM and IFM genuinely different, or are they two descriptions of the same underlying dynamics? We show that they coincide for a natural subclass of IFM that we call forward-only IFM. Specifically, we construct a bijection between CFM and forward-only IFM. We further show that general IFM is strictly more expressive: it includes EFM and other interaction fields that cannot be realized within the standard CFM formulation. Finally, we highlight how this duality can benefit both frameworks: it provides a probabilistic interpretation of forward-only IFM and yields novel, IFM-driven techniques for CFM.",

To drive the research towards better coding agents, we require challenging benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate the ability of such agents to perform various software engineering tasks. However, popular coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and SWE-Bench focus on narrowly scoped tasks such as competition programming and patch generation. In reality, software engineers have to handle a broader set of tasks for real-world software development. To address this gap, we propose OmniCode, a novel software engineering benchmark that contains a broader and more diverse set of task categories beyond code or patch generation. Overall, OmniCode contains 1794 tasks spanning three programming languages (Python, Java, and C++) and four key categories: bug fixing, test generation, code review fixing, and style fixing. In contrast to prior software engineering benchmarks, the tasks in OmniCode are (1) manually validated to eliminate ill-defined problems, and (2) synthetically crafted or recently curated to avoid data leakage issues, presenting a new framework for synthetically generating diverse software tasks from limited real-world data. We evaluate OmniCode with popular agent frameworks such as SWE-Agent and show that while they may perform well on bug fixing for Python, they fall short on tasks such as Test Generation and in languages such as C++ and Java.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be effective tools for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) applications. Although many LLMs are multilingual, most remain English-centric and perform poorly on low-resource languages. Recently, several Southeast Asia-focused LLMs have been developed, but none are truly open source, as they do not publicly disclose their training data. Truly open-source models are important for transparency and for enabling a deeper and more precise understanding of LLM internals and development, including biases, generalization, and multilinguality. Motivated by recent advances demonstrating the effectiveness of parallel data in improving multilingual performance, we conduct controlled and comprehensive experiments to study the effectiveness of parallel data in continual pretraining of LLMs. Our findings show that using only parallel data is the most effective way to extend an LLM to new languages. Using just 34.7B tokens of parallel data and 180 hours on 8x NVIDIA H200 GPUs, we built OpenSeal, the first truly open Southeast Asian LLM that rivals the performance of existing models of similar size.",

In this work, we show that neither is essential. We introduce HopFormer, a graph Transformer that injects structure exclusively through head-specific n-hop masked sparse attention, without the use of positional encodings or architectural modifications. This design provides explicit and interpretable control over receptive fields while enabling genuinely sparse attention whose computational cost scales linearly with mask sparsity. Through extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse graph structures. Our results further reveal that dense global attention is often unnecessary: on graphs with strong small-world properties, localized attention yields more stable and consistently high performance, while on graphs with weaker small-world effects, global attention offers diminishing returns. Together, these findings challenge prevailing assumptions in graph Transformer design and highlight sparsity-controlled attention as a principled and efficient alternative.",

        "abstract": "The rapid digitalization of customer service has intensified the demand for conversational agents capable of providing accurate and natural interactions. In the Algerian context, this is complicated by the linguistic complexity of Darja, a dialect characterized by non-standardized orthography, extensive code-switching with French, and the simultaneous use of Arabic and Latin (Arabizi) scripts. This paper introduces DziriBOT, a hybrid intelligent conversational agent specifically engineered to overcome these challenges. We propose a multi-layered architecture that integrates specialized Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), allowing for both structured service flows and dynamic, knowledge-intensive responses grounded in curated enterprise documentation. To address the low-resource nature of Darja, we systematically evaluate three distinct approaches: a sparse-feature Rasa pipeline, classical machine learning baselines, and transformer-based fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned DziriBERT model achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results significantly outperform traditional baselines, particularly in handling orthographic noise and rare intents. Ultimately, DziriBOT provides a robust, scalable solution that bridges the gap between formal language models and the linguistic realities of Algerian users, offering a blueprint for dialect-aware automation in the regional market.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in LLMs have led to significant breakthroughs in various AI applications. However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI.",

For speaker verification, we adapt a low-complexity convolutional neural network that fuses 2D and 1D features at multiple scales, trained with the SphereFace loss. Additionally, contrastive circle loss is applied to adaptively weight positive and negative pairs within each training batch, enabling the network to better distinguish between hard and easy sample pairs.

We investigate evaluation reliability by holding generation conditions constant while varying target language. Using synthetic customer-support dialogues generated with identical parameters across Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, we test whether automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge scoring produce stable model rankings across these morphologically rich, related Finno-Ugric languages. With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences.\nThis controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment. Our findings suggest that zero-shot judge transfer is unreliable for discourse-level assessment in morphologically rich languages, motivating language-specific calibration against targeted human baselines.

These models achieve long-term forecasting mainly by scaling up the model size rather than through genuinely autoregressive (AR) rollout. From the perspective of large language model training, the traditional training process for time-series forecasting models ignores temporal causality. In this paper, we propose a novel training method for time-series forecasting that enforces two key properties: (1) AR prediction errors should increase with the forecasting horizon. Any violation of this principle is considered random guessing and is explicitly penalized in the loss function, and (2) the method enables models to concatenate short-term AR predictions for forming flexible long-term forecasts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, achieving an MSE reduction of more than 10% compared to iTransformer and other recent strong baselines. Furthermore, it enables short-horizon forecasting models to perform reliable long-term predictions at horizons over 7.5 times longer. Code is available at https://github.com/LizhengMathAi/AROpt",

While investigating these phenomena have recently received attention, explaining their appearance is still overlooked. Classic explainable AI (XAI) methods can surface failures at a single checkpoint of a model, but they are structurally ill-suited to justify what changed internally across different checkpoints and which explanatory claims are warranted about that change. We take the position that behavioral shifts should be explained comparatively: the core target should be the intervention-induced shift between a reference model and an intervened model, rather than any single model in isolation. To this aim we formulate a Comparative XAI ($\\Delta$-XAI) framework with a set of desiderata to be taken into account when designing proper explaining methods. To highlight how $\\Delta$-XAI methods work, we introduce a set of possible pipelines, relate them to the desiderata, and provide a concrete $\\Delta$-XAI experiment.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities in solving complex real-world problems. Yet, the internal mechanisms driving these complex reasoning behaviors remain opaque. Existing interpretability approaches targeting reasoning either identify components (e.g., neurons) correlated with special textual patterns, or rely on human-annotated contrastive pairs to derive control vectors. Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves more precise localization and enables reliable modulation of reasoning behaviors (e.g., reasoning capability, reasoning strength) across diverse reasoning models.",

We study a controlled setting in which Llama-3.2 generates samples from a normal distribution by implicitly inferring its parameters (mean and standard deviation) given only samples from the distribution in context. We find representations of curved \"belief manifolds\" for these parameters form with sufficient in-context learning and study how the model adapts when the distribution suddenly changes. While standard linear steering often pushes the model off-manifold and induces coupled, out-of-distribution shifts, geometry and field-aware steering better preserves the intended belief family. Our work demonstrates an example of linear field probing (LFP) as a simple approach to tile the data manifold and make interventions that respect the underlying geometry. We conclude that rich structure emerges naturally in LLMs and that purely linear concept representations are often an inadequate abstraction.",

Current dense methods suffer computational waste on empty voxels, while sparse query-based approaches lack robustness in diverse and complex indoor scenes. In this paper, we propose DiScene, a novel sparse query-based framework that leverages multi-level distillation to achieve efficient and robust occupancy prediction. In particular, our method incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Multi-level Consistent Knowledge Distillation strategy, which transfers hierarchical representations from large teacher models to lightweight students through coordinated alignment across four levels, including encoder-level feature alignment, query-level feature matching, prior-level spatial guidance, and anchor-level high-confidence knowledge transfer and (2) a Teacher-Guided Initialization policy, employing optimized parameter warm-up to accelerate model convergence. Validated on the Occ-Scannet benchmark, DiScene achieves 23.2 FPS without depth priors while outperforming our baseline method, OPUS, by 36.1% and even better than the depth-enhanced version, OPUSâ . With depth integration, DiSceneâ  attains new SOTA performance, surpassing EmbodiedOcc by 3.7% with 1.62$\\times$ faster inference speed.

This disparity is particularly evident in in-context learning scenarios, where providing demonstrations in English but testing on non-English inputs leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs develop a universal semantic space for understanding languages, where different languages are encoded as distinct directions within this space. Based on this hypothesis, we propose language vectors -- a training-free language steering approach that leverages activation differences between source and target languages to guide model behavior. We steer the model generations by adding the vector to the intermediate model activations during inference. This is done to make the model's internal representations shift towards the target language space without any parameter updates. We evaluate our method across three datasets and test on a total of 19 languages on three different models. Our results show consistent improvements on multilingual in-context learning over baselines across all tasks and languages tested. Beyond performance gains, hierarchical clustering of steering vectors reveals meaningful linguistic structure aligned with language families. These vectors also successfully transfer across tasks, demonstrating that these representations are task-agnostic.",

Although general locomotion policies demonstrate capabilities across broad terrain distributions, they often struggle with arbitrary and highly challenging environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a real-to-sim-to-real framework that leverages rapid test-time training (TTT) on novel terrains, significantly enhancing the robot's capability to traverse extremely difficult geometries. We adopt a two-stage end-to-end learning paradigm: a policy is first pre-trained on diverse procedurally generated terrains, followed by rapid fine-tuning on high-fidelity meshes reconstructed from real-world captures. Specifically, we develop a feed-forward, efficient, and high-fidelity geometry reconstruction pipeline using RGB-D inputs, ensuring both speed and quality during test-time training. We demonstrate that TTT-Parkour empowers humanoid robots to master complex obstacles, including wedges, stakes, boxes, trapezoids, and narrow beams. The whole pipeline of capturing, reconstructing, and test-time training requires less than 10 minutes on most tested terrains. Extensive experiments show that the policy after test-time training exhibits robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability.",

To model this hierarchy, we employ Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RVQ-VAEs) to learn a coarse-to-fine representation of motion. We further enhance the disentanglement by integrating contrastive learning and a novel information leakage loss with codebook learning to organize the content and the style across different codebooks. We harness this disentangled representation using our simple and effective inference-time technique Quantized Code Swapping, which enables motion style transfer without requiring any fine-tuning for unseen styles.

In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

        "abstract": "Can Large language models (LLMs) learn to reason without any weight update and only through in-context learning (ICL)? ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

In deep-uncertainty decisions (where objectives are contested and reversals are costly), scaling fluent agreement amplifies poor commitments faster than it builds expertise. We argue reliable human-AI partnership requires a shift from answer generation to collaborative premise governance over a knowledge substrate, negotiating only what is decision-critical. A discrepancy-driven control loop operates over this substrate: detecting conflicts, localizing misalignment via typed discrepancies (teleological, epistemic, procedural), and triggering bounded negotiation through decision slices. Commitment gating blocks action on uncommitted load-bearing premises unless overridden under logged risk; value-gated challenge allocates probing under interaction cost.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority.",

We propose ROG, a retrieval-augmented framework that combines query-aware neighborhood retrieval with large language model (LLM) chain-of-thought reasoning. ROG decomposes a multi-operator query into a sequence of single-operator sub-queries and grounds each step in compact, query-relevant neighborhood evidence. Intermediate answer sets are cached and reused across steps, improving consistency on deep reasoning chains. This design reduces compounding errors and yields more robust inference on complex and negation-heavy queries. Overall, ROG provides a practical alternative to embedding-based logical reasoning by replacing learned operators with retrieval-grounded, step-wise inference. Experiments on standard KG reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains over strong embedding-based baselines, with the largest improvements on high-complexity and negation-heavy query types.",

Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping. Our results demonstrate that SLIME achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining higher generation stability.",

Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack.

To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.",

We formalize this threat model as Tag-Along Attacks: a scenario where a tool-less adversary \"tags along\" on the trusted privileges of a safety-aligned Operator to induce prohibited tool use through conversation alone. To validate this threat, we present Slingshot, a 'cold-start' reinforcement learning framework that autonomously discovers emergent attack vectors, revealing a critical insight: in our setting, learned attacks tend to converge to short, instruction-like syntactic patterns rather than multi-turn persuasion. On held-out extreme-difficulty tasks, Slingshot achieves a 67.0% success rate against a Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ Operator (vs. 1.7% baseline), reducing the expected attempts to first success (on solved tasks) from 52.3 to 1.3. Crucially, Slingshot transfers zero-shot to several model families, including closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Flash (56.0% attack success rate) and defensive-fine-tuned open-source models like Meta-SecAlign-8B (39.2% attack success rate).

Although recent generative approaches such as diffusion models, flow matching, and Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) have achieved promising results, they often satisfy only a subset of these requirements. To address this, we introduce PRISM, a single-pass policy based on a batch-global rejection-sampling variant of IMLE. PRISM couples a temporal multisensory encoder (integrating RGB, depth, tactile, audio, and proprioception) with a linear-attention generator using a Performer architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of PRISM on a diverse real-world hardware suite, including loco-manipulation using a Unitree Go2 with a 7-DoF arm D1 and tabletop manipulation with a UR5 manipulator. Across challenging physical tasks such as pre-manipulation parking, high-precision insertion, and multi-object pick-and-place, PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies by 10-25% in success rate while maintaining high-frequency (30-50 Hz) closed-loop control. We further validate our approach on large-scale simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, MetaWorld, and Robomimic. In CALVIN (10% data split), PRISM improves success rates by approximately 25% over diffusion and approximately 20% over flow matching, while simultaneously reducing trajectory jerk by 20x-50x. These results position PRISM as a fast, accurate, and multisensory imitation policy that retains multimodal action coverage without the latency of iterative sampling.",

By injecting controlled synthetic uniformly random noise into otherwise clean datasets, we analyze training dynamics across model sizes ranging from 480M to 5.2B parameters. We show that noisy data indeed induces training loss divergence, and that the probability of divergence depends strongly on the noise type, amount of noise, and model scale. We further find that noise-induced divergences exhibit activation patterns distinct from those caused by high learning rates, and we provide diagnostics that differentiate these two failure modes.

A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), a two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying a contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies. We find that DAIL can leverage fewer than 1000 high-quality expert solutions to achieve 10-25% pass@k gains on Qwen2.5-Instruct and Qwen3 models, improve reasoning efficiency by 2x to 4x, and enable out-of-domain generalization.",

These candidates are then assessed and re-ranked by another fine-tuned LLM to improve misconception relevance.

We introduce a prompting method that structures reasoning as discrete, semantically coherent thought steps, and show that models are able to reliably localize errors within this structure, while failing to do so in conventional, unstructured chain-of-thought reasoning. Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization. Upon verification, the model localizes the first erroneous step, and the system backtracks to generate alternative reasoning from the last correct point. When asked to correct reasoning verified as incorrect by an oracle, Thought-ICS achieves 20-40% self-correction lift. In a completely autonomous setting without external verification, it outperforms contemporary self-correction baselines.",

We show that, under local approximations, the resulting update admits a MAML-style interpretation with a single implicit inner step: replay supplies an old-task gradient signal (query-like), while the Fisher-weighted penalty provides an efficient offline curvature shaping (support-like). This yields an emergent meta-learning property in continual learning: the model becomes an initialization that rapidly \\emph{re-converges} to prior task optima after each task transition, without explicitly optimizing a bilevel objective.

Some higher-dimensional alternatives to self-attention have been proposed to address this, including higher-order attention and Strassen attention, which can perform some of these polyadic tasks in exchange for slower, superquadratic running times.\nIn this work, we define a vast class of generalizations of self-attention, which we call poly-attention mechanisms. Our mechanisms can incorporate arbitrary higher-order (tensor) computations as well as arbitrary relationship structures between the input tokens, and they include the aforementioned alternatives as special cases. We then systematically study their computational complexity and representational strength, including giving new algorithms and matching complexity-theoretic lower bounds on the time complexity of computing the attention matrix exactly as well as approximately, and tightly determining which polyadic tasks they can each perform. Our results give interesting trade-offs between different desiderata for these mechanisms, including a tight relationship between how expressive a mechanism is, and how large the coefficients in the model may be so that the mechanism can be approximated in almost-linear time.\nNotably, we give a new attention mechanism which can be computed exactly in quadratic time, and which can perform function composition for any fixed number of functions. Prior mechanisms, even for just composing two functions, could only be computed in superquadratic time, and our new lower bounds show that faster algorithms for them are not possible.",

Studying canopy trees at scale requires accurate delineation of individual tree crowns, typically performed using high-resolution aerial imagery. Despite advances in transformer-based models for individual tree crown segmentation, performance remains low in most forests, especially tropical ones. To this end, we introduce SelvaMask, a new tropical dataset containing over 8,800 manually delineated tree crowns across three Neotropical forest sites in Panama, Brazil, and Ecuador. SelvaMask features comprehensive annotations, including an inter-annotator agreement evaluation, capturing the dense structure of tropical forests and highlighting the difficulty of the task. Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a modular detection-segmentation pipeline that adapts vision foundation models (VFMs), using domain-specific detection-prompter. Our approach reaches state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both zero-shot generalist models and fully supervised end-to-end methods in dense tropical forests. We validate these gains on external tropical and temperate datasets, demonstrating that SelvaMask serves as both a challenging benchmark and a key enabler for generalized forest monitoring. Our code and dataset will be released publicly.",

        "abstract": "Large language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs across diverse domains; however, they can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs. For responsible LLM application, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques are used to estimate a model's uncertainty about its outputs, indicating the likelihood that those outputs may be problematic. For LLM reasoning tasks, it is essential to estimate the uncertainty not only for the final answer, but also for the intermediate steps of the reasoning, as this can enable more fine-grained and targeted interventions. In this study, we explore what UQ metrics better reflect the LLM's ``intermediate uncertainty''during reasoning. Our study reveals that an LLMs' incorrect reasoning steps tend to contain tokens which are highly sensitive to the perturbations on the preceding token embeddings. In this way, incorrect (uncertain) intermediate steps can be readily identified using this sensitivity score as guidance in practice. In our experiments, we show such perturbation-based metric achieves stronger uncertainty quantification performance compared with baseline methods such as token (generation) probability and token entropy. Besides, different from approaches that rely on multiple sampling, the perturbation-based metrics offer better simplicity and efficiency.",

This approach unifies generation and editing within a shared representation, mirroring the human cognitive process of planning followed by refinement. We support this framework by systematically constructing a large-scale reasoning-centric dataset (~300k samples) covering five major knowledge domains (e.g., cultural commonsense, physics, etc.) for planning, alongside an agent-generated corpus for visual self-correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniReason achieves advanced performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks such as WISE, KrisBench and UniREditBench, while maintaining superior general synthesis capabilities.",

Fine-grained MoE, featuring hundreds of well-trained experts per layer and multi-expert activation per token, offers an unexplored alternative through its rich routing space. We empirically characterize fine-grained MoE routing and uncover an informative pattern: router scores exhibit a certain head of high-confidence experts followed by an uncertain tail of low-confidence candidates. While single-run greedy accuracy remains stable when fewer experts are activated, multi-sample pass@n degrades significantly-suggesting that the certain head governs core reasoning capability while the uncertain tail correlates with reasoning diversity. Motivated by these findings, we propose Expert-Sample, a training-free method that preserves high-confidence selections while injecting controlled stochasticity into the uncertain tail, enabling diverse generation without destabilizing outputs. Evaluated on multiple fine-grained MoE models across math, knowledge reasoning, and code tasks, Expert-Sample consistently improves pass@n and verification-based accuracy. On Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct evaluated on GPQA-Diamond with 32 parallel samples, pass@32 rises from 85.4% to 91.9%, and accuracy improves from 59.1% to 62.6% with Best-of-N verification.",

Traditional approaches such as random sampling, greedy information maximization, and round-robin coverage treat each decision in isolation, unable to learn adaptive strategies from experience. We propose Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), which learns experimental design as a sequential policy. Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p < 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2). Notably, the learned policy autonomously discovers that collider mechanisms require concentrated interventions on parent variables, a theoretically-grounded strategy that emerges purely from experience. This suggests preference-based learning can recover principled experimental strategies, complementing theory with learned domain adaptation.",

The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household.",

We introduce MetaCLASS, a learning-science grounded framework that formulates metacognitive tutoring as move selection over 11 interpretable actions aligned to self-regulated learning processes. MetaCLASS uses a two-phase framework that first plans a pedagogical trajectory conditioned on learner profiles (calibration, help-seeking) and then generates natural dialogue consistent with that plan. This yields a dataset of 1,015 conversations (7,711 turns) annotated with turn-level metacognitive labels, and validated for pedagogical contingency and trajectory adherence. We benchmark nine LLMs on predicting the next coach move given the problem and dialogue context. The best model achieves only 43.2\\% accuracy, and models exhibit compulsive intervention bias: in turns where effective metacognitive tutoring requires silent (41.7\\% of cases), models predict `no intervention' only 4.2\\% of the time, while severely over-predicting high-intervention moves.

While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RL-CRP framework effectively reduces inter-server conflicts and significantly improves training efficiency in terms of convergence speed and communication cost.",

This bias persists even when models generate step-wise explanations, indicating that intermediate rationales may inherit the same semantic shortcuts that affect answers. Recent approaches propose mitigating this issue by increasing inference-time structural constraints, either by encouraging abstract intermediate representations or by intervening directly in the model's internal computations; however, reliably suppressing semantic interference remains an open challenge. To make formal deduction less sensitive to semantic content, we introduce a framework for abstraction-guided reasoning that explicitly separates structural inference from lexical semantics. We construct paired content-laden and abstract syllogisms and use the model's activations on abstract inputs to define an abstract reasoning space. We then learn lightweight Abstractors that, from content-conditioned residual-stream states, predict representations aligned with this space and integrate these predictions via multi-layer interventions during the forward pass. Using cross-lingual transfer as a test bed, we show that abstraction-aligned steering reduces content-driven errors and improves validity-sensitive performance.

Moreover, evaluations on localization and steering benchmarks show that MFA outperforms unsupervised baselines, is competitive with supervised localization methods, and often achieves stronger steering performance than sparse autoencoders. Together, our findings position local geometry, expressed through subspaces, as a promising unit of analysis for scalable concept discovery and model control, accounting for complex structures that isolated directions fail to capture.",

This shift has sparked interest in using intermediate visualizations as a reasoning aid, akin to human mental imagery. Central to this idea is the ability to form, maintain, and manipulate visual representations in a goal-oriented manner. To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning. MentisOculi establishes the necessary foundation to analyze and close this gap across diverse model families.",

(2023) introduced a list of indicators for consciousness in artificial systems based on neuroscientific theories. In this work, we evaluate a key indicator from this list, called HOT-3, which tests for agency guided by a general belief-formation and action selection system that updates beliefs based on meta-cognitive monitoring. We view beliefs as representations in the model's latent space that emerge in response to a given input, and introduce a metric to quantify their dominance during generation. Analyzing the dynamics between competing beliefs across models and tasks reveals three key findings: (1) external manipulations systematically modulate internal belief formation, (2) belief formation causally drives the model's action selection, and (3) models can monitor and report their own belief states. Together, these results provide empirical support for the existence of belief-guided agency and meta-cognitive monitoring in LLMs. More broadly, our work lays methodological groundwork for investigating the emergence of agency, beliefs, and meta-cognition in LLMs.",

Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form \"$A \\to A$\" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data. Our work provides a novel theoretical foundation for the reversal curse and offers a principled, low-cost path to encouraging LLMs to learn higher-level rules from data.",

While prior work has extensively explored depth expansion, width expansion remains significantly understudied, with the few existing methods limited to the early stages of training. However, expanding width during the mid-stage is essential for maximizing computational savings, yet it remains a formidable challenge due to severe training instabilities. Empirically, we show that naive initialization at this stage disrupts activation statistics, triggering loss spikes, while copy-based initialization introduces gradient symmetry that hinders feature diversity. To address these issues, we propose SPARKLING (balancing {S}ignal {P}reservation {A}nd symmet{R}y brea{K}ing for width-progressive {L}earn{ING}), a novel framework for mid-stage width expansion. Our method achieves signal preservation via RMS-scale consistency, stabilizing activation statistics during expansion.

Extensive experiments on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models demonstrate that, across multiple width axes and optimizer families, SPARKLING consistently outperforms training from scratch and reduces training cost by up to 35% under $2\\times$ width expansion.",

To narrow this gap, we present HumanX, a full-stack framework that compiles human video into generalizable, real-world interaction skills for humanoids, without task-specific rewards. HumanX integrates two co-designed components: XGen, a data generation pipeline that synthesizes diverse and physically plausible robot interaction data from video while supporting scalable data augmentation; and XMimic, a unified imitation learning framework that learns generalizable interaction skills. Evaluated across five distinct domains--basketball, football, badminton, cargo pickup, and reactive fighting--HumanX successfully acquires 10 different skills and transfers them zero-shot to a physical Unitree G1 humanoid. The learned capabilities include complex maneuvers such as pump-fake turnaround fadeaway jumpshots without any external perception, as well as interactive tasks like sustained human-robot passing sequences over 10 consecutive cycles--learned from a single video demonstration. Our experiments show that HumanX achieves over 8 times higher generalization success than prior methods, demonstrating a scalable and task-agnostic pathway for learning versatile, real-world robot interactive skills.",

To this end, we present \\textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \\emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \\emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \\emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.",

To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory.

Nevertheless, at the limits of model capability, CoT often proves insufficient, and its strictly sequential nature constrains test-time scalability. A potential alternative is divide-and-conquer (DAC) reasoning, which decomposes a complex problem into subproblems to facilitate more effective exploration of the solution. Although promising, our analysis reveals a fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the model's capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes a problem into a group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training. Under comparable training, our DAC-style framework endows the model with a higher performance ceiling and stronger test-time scalability, surpassing CoT by 8.6% in Pass@1 and 6.3% in Pass@32 on competition-level benchmarks.",

At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale.",

However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing a simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm.

        "abstract": "Direct alignment methods are increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, many real-world alignment problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, where naive aggregation of preferences can lead to unstable training and poor trade-offs. In particular, weighted loss methods may fail to identify update directions that simultaneously improve all objectives, and existing multi-objective approaches often rely on explicit reward models, introducing additional complexity and distorting user-specified preferences. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multi-objective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines.",

The success of modeling brain rhythms using an artificial dynamical system of coupled oscillations motivates a \"first principle\" for brain-inspired machine intelligence based on a shared synchronization mechanism, termed HoloGraph. This principle enables graph neural networks to move beyond conventional heat diffusion paradigms toward modeling oscillatory synchronization.

The system constructs four types of analytical agents-announcement, event, price momentum, and market-each conducting analysis from different dimensions; then the prediction agent integrates these multi-source signals to output directional probability distributions across multiple time horizons, then the decision agent generates discrete position adjustment signals based on the prediction results and risk control constraints, thereby forming a closed loop of analysis-prediction-decision-execution. This study further compares two prediction model pathways: for the prediction agent, directly calling the general-purpose large model DeepSeek-R1 versus using a specialized small model Qwen3-8B fine-tuned via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alignment. In the backtest from October 2024 to October 2025, both agent-based strategies significantly outperformed the buy-and-hold benchmark in terms of cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. The results indicate that the multi-agent framework can effectively enhance the risk-adjusted return of REITs trading, and the fine-tuned small model performs close to or even better than the general-purpose large model in some scenarios.",

Herein, we conduct an evaluation study that compares 3 different LLMs, namely, DeBERTa, RoBERTa and FinBERT, for sentiment-driven stock prediction. Our results suggest that DeBERTa outperforms the other two models with an accuracy of 75% and that an ensemble model that combines the three models can increase the accuracy to about 80%.

We demonstrate three practical capabilities: a high-fidelity polymer property prediction and generative design pipeline, a fully automated multimodal workflow for biopolymer structure characterization, and a metacognitive agent framework that can monitor performance and improve execution strategies over time. On a held-out test set of 1,251 polymers, our PolyGNN agent achieves strong predictive accuracy, reaching R2 = 0.89 for glass-transition temperature (Tg ), R2 = 0.82 for tensile strength, R2 = 0.75 for elongation, and R2 = 0.91 for density. The framework also provides uncertainty estimates via multiagent consensus and scales with linear complexity to at least 10,000 polymers, enabling high-throughput screening at low computational cost. For a representative workload, the system completes inference in 16.3 s using about 2 GB of memory and 0.1 GPU hours, at an estimated cost of about $0.08. On a dedicated Tg benchmark, our approach attains R2 = 0.78, outperforming strong baselines including single-LLM prediction (R2 = 0.67), group-contribution methods (R2 = 0.71), and ChemCrow (R2 = 0.66).

Through systematic comparison, six methods including diffusion maps (DM) are selected to construct low-dimensional representations. Based on these, a data-driven stochastic differential equation model is established to robustly estimate the probability evolution scoring function of the system. Building on this, a new Score Function (SF) indicator is defined by incorporating SchrÃ¶dinger bridge theory to quantify the likelihood of significant state transitions in the system. Experiments demonstrate that this indicator exhibits higher sensitivity and robustness in epilepsy prediction, enables earlier identification of critical points, and clearly captures dynamic features across various stages before and after seizure onset.

Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment.\nTo bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use.

A two-stage algorithm is developed: A spectral initializer computed via the power method on a Hermitian dual quaternion measurement matrix, followed by a dual quaternion generalized power method (DQGPM) that enforces feasibility through per-iteration projection. The estimation error bounds are established for spectral estimators, and DQGPM is shown to admit a finite-iteration error bound and achieves linear error contraction up to an explicit noise-dependent threshold.

However, most RL algorithms rely on the Markov Decision Process assumption, which is violated in practical cyber-physical systems affected by sensing delays, actuation latencies, and communication constraints. Such time delays introduce memory effects that can significantly degrade performance and compromise stability, particularly in networked and multi-agent environments. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL methods designed to address time delays in control systems. We first formalize the main classes of delays and analyze their impact on the Markov property. We then systematically categorize existing approaches into five major families: state augmentation and history-based representations, recurrent policies with learned memory, predictor-based and model-aware methods, robust and domain-randomized training strategies, and safe RL frameworks with explicit constraint handling. For each family, we discuss underlying principles, practical advantages, and inherent limitations. A comparative analysis highlights key trade-offs among these approaches and provides practical guidelines for selecting suitable methods under different delay characteristics and safety requirements. Finally, we identify open challenges and promising research directions, including stability certification, large-delay learning, multi-agent communication co-design, and standardized benchmarking. This survey aims to serve as a unified reference for researchers and practitioners developing reliable RL-based controllers in delay-affected cyber-physical systems.",

In this work, we propose a novel alignment framework by leveraging the underlying nature of the alignment problem -- sampling from reward-weighted distributions -- and show that it applies to both diffusion models (via score guidance) and flow matching models (via velocity guidance). The score function (velocity field) required for the reward-weighted distribution can be decomposed into the pre-trained score (velocity field) plus a conditional expectation of the reward. For the alignment on the diffusion model, we identify a fundamental challenge: the adversarial nature of the guidance term can introduce undesirable artifacts in the generated images. Therefore, we propose a finetuning-free framework that trains a guidance network to estimate the conditional expectation of the reward. We achieve comparable performance to finetuning-based models with one-step generation with at least a 60% reduction in computational cost. For the alignment on flow matching, we propose a training-free framework that improves the generation quality without additional computational cost.",

To address this challenge, we propose learning state policies that recommend desirable next-state transitions rather than actions. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a simple yet novel state discretisation transformation and propose Offline State-Only DecQN (\\algo), a value-based algorithm designed to pre-train state policies from action-free data. \\algo{} integrates the transformation to scale efficiently to high-dimensional problems while avoiding instability and overfitting associated with continuous state prediction. Second, we propose a novel mechanism for guided online learning that leverages these pre-trained state policies to accelerate the learning of online agents. Together, these components establish a scalable and practical framework for leveraging action-free datasets to accelerate online RL.

Inspired by the framework of diffusion models developed for generative modeling, we introduce a sampling algorithm based on the simulation of a non-equilibrium deterministic dynamics that transports an easy-to-sample noise distribution toward the target. At the marginal level, the induced density path follows a prescribed stochastic interpolant between the noise and target distributions, specifically constructed to respect the underlying Riemannian geometry. In contrast to related generative modeling approaches that rely on machine learning, our method is entirely training-free. It instead builds on iterative posterior sampling procedures using only standard Monte Carlo techniques, thereby extending recent diffusion-based sampling methodologies beyond the Euclidean setting. We complement our approach with a rigorous theoretical analysis and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of multi-modal sampling problems, including high-dimensional and heavy-tailed examples.",

We formalize this phenomenon as generative distortion, defined as the mismatch between the CFG-induced sampling distribution and the true conditional distribution. Considering Gaussian mixtures and their exact scores, and leveraging tools from statistical physics, we characterize the onset of distortion in a high-dimensional regime as a function of the number of classes. Our analysis reveals that distortions emerge through a phase transition in the effective potential governing the guided dynamics. In particular, our dynamical mean-field analysis shows that distortion persists when the number of modes grows exponentially with dimension, but vanishes in the sub-exponential regime. Consistent with prior finite-dimensional results, we further demonstrate that vanilla CFG shifts the mean and shrinks the variance of the conditional distribution. We show that standard CFG schedules are fundamentally incapable of preventing variance shrinkage. Finally, we propose a theoretically motivated guidance schedule featuring a negative-guidance window, which mitigates loss of diversity while preserving class separability.",

We term this property the \\emph{zero-flow criterion}. Second, we show that this criterion can certify conditional independence, thereby extracting \\emph{sufficient information} from the data. Third, we translate this criterion into a tractable, simulation-free loss function that enables learning amortized Markov blankets in graphical models and latent representations in self-supervised learning tasks.

We characterize the numerical behavior of this pipeline, including finite-difference bias, floating-point noise amplification, and their effect on Krylov stability in fp32 and bf16, and derive practical operating regimes that are validated empirically. We further provide end-to-end runtime and memory scaling laws, showing that full-operator spectral probing incurs only a modest constant-factor overhead over first-order training. Crucially, direct access to the Hessian reveals that widely used block-diagonal curvature approximations can fail catastrophically, exhibiting order-one relative error and poor directional alignment even in mid-scale LLMs. Together, our results demonstrate that foundation-model Hessian spectra are both computable and qualitatively misrepresented by prevailing approximations, opening the door to principled curvature-based analysis at scale.",

First, the contaminated MoE model has been studied solely in regression settings, while its theoretical foundation in classification settings remains absent. Second, previous works on MoE models for classification capture pointwise convergence rates for parameter estimation without any guaranty of minimax optimality. In this work, we close these gaps by performing, for the first time, the convergence analysis of a contaminated mixture of multinomial logistic experts with homogeneous and heterogeneous structures, respectively. In each regime, we characterize uniform convergence rates for estimating parameters under challenging settings where ground-truth parameters vary with the sample size. Furthermore, we also establish corresponding minimax lower bounds to ensure that these rates are minimax optimal. Notably, our theories offer an important insight into the design of contaminated MoE, that is, expert heterogeneity yields faster parameter estimation rates and, therefore, is more sample-efficient than expert homogeneity.",

Such evaluations assess each policy independently, overlook correlations and interactions, and fail to explain why strategies ultimately persist or vanish in evolving markets. We shift to an ecological perspective, where trading strategies are modeled as adaptive agents that interact and learn within a shared market. Instead of proposing a new strategy, we present FinEvo, an ecological game formalism for studying the evolutionary dynamics of multi-agent financial strategies. At the individual level, heterogeneous ML-based traders-rule-based, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language model (LLM) agents-adapt using signals such as historical prices and external news. At the population level, strategy distributions evolve through three designed mechanisms-selection, innovation, and environmental perturbation-capturing the dynamic forces of real markets. Together, these two layers of adaptation link evolutionary game theory with modern learning dynamics, providing a principled environment for studying strategic behavior. Experiments with external shocks and real-world news streams show that FinEvo is both stable for reproducibility and expressive in revealing context-dependent outcomes. Strategies may dominate, collapse, or form coalitions depending on their competitors-patterns invisible to static backtests. By reframing strategy evaluation as an ecological game formalism, FinEvo provides a unified, mechanism-level protocol for analyzing robustness, adaptation, and emergent dynamics in multi-agent financial markets, and may offer a means to explore the potential impact of macroeconomic policies and financial regulations on price evolution and equilibrium.",

Full-model fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting, while parameter-efficient methods like LoRA apply adaptation uniformly across layers, overlooking internal representations thus compromising effectiveness and efficiency. We analyze multilingual ASR models and reveal a U-shaped adaptability pattern: early and late layers are language-specific and require more adaptation, while intermediate layers retain shared semantics and need less. Building on this observation, we propose DAMA, a Depth-Aware Model Adaptation framework that allocates adaptation capacity according to each layer's role. DAMA also introduces Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based initialization to constrain adaptation and preserve the U-shaped pattern, as well as a frozen middle-layer basis for further efficiency. Evaluated on 18 low-resource languages across two benchmark datasets, DAMA matches or surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy with 80% fewer trainable parameters, achieves a 29% error reduction under extreme data scarcity, and significantly improves memory, training time, and computational efficiency over baselines. These results highlight the benefits of structure-aware adaptation for efficient, scalable multilingual ASR.",

Our main result is that, for (i) finite-horizon linear systems with Gaussian policies and linear state-feedback, and (ii) finite-horizon polynomial systems with Gaussian policies and polynomial feedback, the NSR of the REINFORCE estimator can be characterized exactly-either in closed form or via numerical moment-evaluation algorithms-without approximation.

These characterizations enable a direct examination of how NSR varies across policy parameters and how it evolves along optimization trajectories (e.g. SGD and Adam).

Nevertheless, there are three notable concerns that have not been addressed in the literature, namely (i) the benefits of the sigmoid gate have not been established under classification settings; (ii) existing sigmoid-gated MoE models may not converge to their ground-truth; and (iii) the effects of a temperature parameter in the sigmoid gate remain theoretically underexplored. To tackle these open problems, we perform a comprehensive analysis of multinomial logistic MoE equipped with a modified sigmoid gate to ensure model convergence. Our results indicate that the sigmoid gate exhibits a lower sample complexity than the softmax gate for both parameter and expert estimation. Furthermore, we find that incorporating a temperature into the sigmoid gate leads to a sample complexity of exponential order due to an intrinsic interaction between the temperature and gating parameters. To overcome this issue, we propose replacing the vanilla inner product score in the gating function with a Euclidean score that effectively removes that interaction, thereby substantially improving the sample complexity to a polynomial order.",

Thirty U.S.-based technology ventures, launched after the training cutoffs of all models studied, were evaluated while fundraising remained in progress and outcomes were unknown. A diverse suite of frontier and open-weight large language models (LLMs) completed 870 pairwise comparisons, producing complete rankings of predicted fundraising success. We benchmarked these forecasts against 346 experienced managers recruited via Prolific and three MBA-trained investors working under monitored conditions. The results are striking: human evaluators achieved rank correlations with actual outcomes between 0.04 and 0.45, while several frontier LLMs exceeded 0.60, with the best (Gemini 2.5 Pro) reaching 0.74 -- correctly ordering nearly four of every five venture pairs. These differences persist across multiple performance metrics and robustness checks. Neither wisdom-of-the-crowd ensembles nor human-AI hybrid teams outperformed the best standalone model.",

In this work, we propose RIR-Former, a grid-free, one-step feed-forward model for RIR reconstruction. By introducing a sinusoidal encoding module into a transformer backbone, our method effectively incorporates microphone position information, enabling interpolation at arbitrary array locations. Furthermore, a segmented multi-branch decoder is designed to separately handle early reflections and late reverberation, improving reconstruction across the entire RIR. Experiments on diverse simulated acoustic environments demonstrate that RIR-Former consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and cosine distance (CD), under varying missing rates and array configurations. These results highlight the potential of our approach for practical deployment and motivate future work on scaling from randomly spaced linear arrays to complex array geometries, dynamic acoustic scenes, and real-world environments.",

We recast associative memory at the level of probability measures, treating a context as a distribution over tokens and viewing attention as an integral operator on measures. Concretely, for mixture contexts $\\nu = I^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^I \\mu^{(i^*)}$ and a query $x_{\\mathrm{q}}(i^*)$, the task decomposes into (i) recall of the relevant component $\\mu^{(i^*)}$ and (ii) prediction from $(\\mu_{i^*},x_\\mathrm{q})$. We study learned softmax attention (not a frozen kernel) trained by empirical risk minimization and show that a shallow measure-theoretic Transformer composed with an MLP learns the recall-and-predict map under a spectral assumption on the input densities. We further establish a matching minimax lower bound with the same rate exponent (up to multiplicative constants), proving sharpness of the convergence order. The framework offers a principled recipe for designing and analyzing Transformers that recall from arbitrarily long, distributional contexts with provable generalization guarantees.",

        "abstract": "In marine towed-streamer seismic acquisition, the nearest hydrophone is often two hundred meter away from the source resulting in missing near-offset traces, which degrades critical processing workflows such as surface-related multiple elimination, velocity analysis, and full-waveform inversion. Existing reconstruction methods, like transform-domain interpolation, often produce kinematic inconsistencies and amplitude distortions, while supervised deep learning approaches require complete ground-truth near-offset data that are unavailable in realistic acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised diffusion-based framework that reconstructs missing near-offset traces without requiring near-offset reference data. Our method leverages overlapping patch extraction with single-trace shifts from the available far-offset section to train a conditional diffusion model, which learns offset-dependent statistical patterns governing event curvature, amplitude variation, and wavelet characteristics. At inference, we perform trace-by-trace recursive extrapolation from the nearest recorded offset toward zero offset, progressively propagating learned prior information from far to near offsets. The generative formulation further provides uncertainty estimates via ensemble sampling, quantifying prediction confidence where validation data are absent. Controlled validation experiments on synthetic and field datasets show substantial performance gains over conventional parabolic Radon transform baselines. Operational deployment on actual near-offset gaps demonstrates practical viability where ground-truth validation is impossible. Notably, the reconstructed waveforms preserve realistic amplitude-versus-offset trends despite training exclusively on far-offset observations, and uncertainty maps accurately identify challenging extrapolation regions.",

For conservation laws, however, long-horizon rollouts are often destabilized when learned updates violate global conservation and, in many applications, additional state bounds such as nonnegative mass and densities or concentrations constrained to [0,1]. Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition. Experiments on shallow-water equations and traffic flow show improved rollout stability and physical consistency over strong baselines. On phase-field spinodal decomposition, the method enables large time-steps with long-range transport, accelerating simulation while preserving microstructure evolution in both pointwise and statistical measures.",

We present a training-free conditional diffusion model framework for learning stochastic flow maps of parameter-dependent SDEs, where both drift and diffusion coefficients depend on physical parameters. The key technical innovation is a joint kernel-weighted Monte Carlo estimator that approximates the conditional score function using trajectory data sampled at discrete parameter values, enabling interpolation across both state space and the continuous parameter domain. Once trained, the resulting generative model produces sample trajectories for any parameter value within the training range without retraining, significantly accelerating parameter studies, uncertainty quantification, and real-time filtering applications. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three numerical examples of increasing complexity, showing accurate approximation of conditional distributions across varying parameter values.",

We present a camera-free 2D LiDAR object detection pipeline that encodes short-term temporal context by stacking three consecutive scans as RGB channels, yielding a compact YOLOv8n input without occupancy-grid construction while preserving angular structure and motion cues. Evaluated in Webots across 160 randomized indoor scenarios with strict scenario-level holdout, the method achieves 98.4% mAP@0.5 (0.778 mAP@0.5:0.95) with 94.9% precision and 94.7% recall on four object classes. On a Raspberry Pi 5, it runs in real time with a mean post-warm-up end-to-end latency of 47.8ms per frame, including scan encoding and postprocessing. Relative to a closely related occupancy-grid LiDAR-YOLO pipeline reported on the same platform, the proposed representation is associated with substantially lower reported end-to-end latency. Although results are simulation-based, they suggest that lightweight temporal encoding can enable accurate and real-time LiDAR-only detection for embedded indoor robotics without capturing RGB appearance.",

These divergences remain finite under support mismatch and yield a geometric interpretation of regularization heuristics used in Kalman ensemble methods. We demonstrate the utility of these divergences in KL-regularized optimal control. In the fully tractable setting of linear time-invariant systems with Gaussian process noise, the classical KL reduces to a quadratic control penalty that becomes singular as process noise vanishes. Our variants remove this singularity, yielding well-posed problems. On a double integrator and a cart-pole example, the resulting controls outperform KL-based regularization.",
