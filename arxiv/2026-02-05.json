        "abstract": "The \"AI Scientist\" paradigm is transforming scientific research by automating key stages of the research process, from idea generation to scholarly writing. This shift is expected to accelerate discovery and expand the scope of scientific inquiry. However, a key question remains unclear: can AI scientists identify meaningful research questions? While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied successfully to task-specific ideation, their potential to conduct strategic, long-term assessments of past breakthroughs and future questions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore a human-AI hybrid solution that integrates the scalable data processing capabilities of AI with the value judgment of human experts. Our methodology is structured in three phases. The first phase, AI-Accelerated Information Gathering, leverages AI's advantage in processing vast amounts of literature to generate a hybrid information base. The second phase, Candidate Question Proposing, utilizes this synthesized data to prompt an ensemble of six diverse LLMs to propose an initial candidate pool, filtered via a cross-model voting mechanism. The third phase, Hybrid Question Selection, refines this pool through a multi-stage filtering process that progressively increases human oversight. To validate this system, we conducted an experiment aiming to identify the Top 10 Scientific Breakthroughs of 2025 and the Top 10 Scientific Questions for 2026 across five major disciplines. Our analysis reveals that while AI agents demonstrate high alignment with human experts in recognizing established breakthroughs, they exhibit greater divergence in forecasting prospective questions, suggesting that human judgment remains crucial for evaluating subjective, forward-looking challenges.",

However, it is unknown how prevalent LLM adoption is across CEE scholarship and whether it meaningfully alters research prose. Inspired by a recent analysis of biomedical abstracts, this study adapts a vocabulary-based frequency-shift methodology to estimate the incidence of LLM-written abstracts in the field of CEE scholarship using 149,452 abstracts published by the American Society of Civil Engineers from 2000 through 2025 as the representative corpus. By quantifying departures from recent vocabulary trends, we estimate 15% and 26% of abstracts published in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Prior to the introduction of LLMs in 2022, CEE publications exhibit long-term trends toward increasing numbers of authors, longer abstracts and sentences, greater use of segmenting punctuation, higher required reading levels, and a shift toward active, first-person verb constructions. Beginning around 2023, however, the frequencies of many excess style words (e.g., enhance) dramatically depart from their historic trajectories, and correspondingly, departures in multiple semantic properties are observed. When abstracts classified as likely LLM-written are isolated, these departures are shown to be largely attributable to LLM-generated text. These abstracts exhibit systematic shifts, including increased word choice diversity, more commas, increased complexity, decreased use of passive constructions, and less qualifying language commonly used to convey uncertainty, such that prose is generally more segmented, syntactically complex, and assertive. Together these findings provide the first large-scale, data-driven assessment of LLM use and effect on CEE scholarly writing.",

We introduce Group Ordinal Policy Optimization (GOPO), a policy optimization method that uses only the ranking of the rewards and discards their magnitudes. Our rank-based transformation of rewards provides several gains, compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), in settings with non-verifiable rewards: (1) consistently higher training/validation reward trajectories, (2) improved LLM-as-judge evaluations across most intermediate training steps, and (3) reaching a policy of comparable quality in substantially less training steps than GRPO. We demonstrate consistent improvements across a range of tasks and model sizes.",

TruKAN replaces the B-spline basis in KAN with a family of truncated power functions derived from k-order spline theory. This change maintains the KAN's expressiveness while enhancing accuracy and training time. Each TruKAN layer combines a truncated power term with a polynomial term and employs either shared or individual knots. TruKAN exhibits greater interpretability than other KAN variants due to its simplified basis functions and knot configurations. By prioritizing interpretable basis functions, TruKAN aims to balance approximation efficacy with transparency. We develop the TruKAN model and integrate it into an advanced EfficientNet-V2-based framework, which is then evaluated on computer vision benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair comparison, we develop various models: MLP-, KAN-, SineKAN and TruKAN-based EfficientNet frameworks and assess their training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures. The training phase uses hybrid optimization to improve convergence stability. Additionally, we investigate layer normalization techniques for all the models and assess the impact of shared versus individual knots in TruKAN. Overall, TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and memory usage on the complex vision task, demonstrating advantages beyond the limited settings explored in prior KAN studies.",

However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DPC$^2$hat significantly improves action understanding and temporal reasoning compared with existing models, establishing a strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.",

This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences. We introduce an open-source benchmarking toolkit and provide recommendations for ecologists to select appropriate methods for sorting their specific taxonomic groups and data.",

We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices. NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous, harm-aware fairness evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM) can struggle with reasoning ability and planning tasks. Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.",

First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus.

In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition.

To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

        "abstract": "Masked self-supervised vision transformers have become a dominant pretraining paradigm, yet their substantial model size poses significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning. A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.",

        "abstract": "Robot Foundation Models (RFMs) represent a promising approach to developing general-purpose home robots. Given the broad capabilities of RFMs, users will inevitably ask an RFM-based robot to perform tasks that the RFM was not trained or evaluated on. In these cases, it is crucial that users understand the risks associated with attempting novel tasks due to the relatively high cost of failure. Furthermore, an informed user who understands an RFM's capabilities will know what situations and tasks the robot can handle. In this paper, we study how non-roboticists interpret performance information from RFM evaluations. These evaluations typically report task success rate (TSR) as the primary performance metric. While TSR is intuitive to experts, it is necessary to validate whether novices also use this information as intended. Toward this end, we conducted a study in which users saw real evaluation data, including TSR, failure case descriptions, and videos from multiple published RFM research projects. The results highlight that non-experts not only use TSR in a manner consistent with expert expectations but also highly value other information types, such as failure cases that are not often reported in RFM evaluations. Furthermore, we find that users want access to both real data from previous evaluations of the RFM and estimates from the robot about how well it will do on a novel task.",

Previous works have proposed hardware-centric caching policies, but how these various caching policies interact with each other and different hardware specification remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we develop \\textbf{SpecMD}, a standardized framework for benchmarking ad-hoc cache policies on various hardware configurations. Using SpecMD, we perform an exhaustive benchmarking of several MoE caching strategies, reproducing and extending prior approaches in controlled settings with realistic constraints. Our experiments reveal that MoE expert access is not consistent with temporal locality assumptions (e.g LRU, LFU). Motivated by this observation, we propose \\textbf{Least-Stale}, a novel eviction policy that exploits MoE's predictable expert access patterns to reduce collision misses by up to $85\\times$ over LRU. With such gains, we achieve over $88\\%$ hit rates with up to $34.7\\%$ Time-to-first-token (TTFT) reduction on OLMoE at only $5\\%$ or $0.6GB$ of VRAM cache capacity.",

In this paper, we develop a sequence mixing layer that aims to find a better compromise between memory-compute costs and long-context processing, which we call online vector-quantized (OVQ) attention. OVQ-attention requires linear compute costs and constant memory, but, unlike linear attention and SSMs, it uses a sparse memory update that allows it to greatly increase the size of its memory state and, consequently, memory capacity. We develop a theoretical basis for OVQ-attention based on Gaussian mixture regression, and we test it on a variety of synthetic long context tasks and on long context language modeling. OVQ-attention shows significant improvements over linear attention baselines and the original VQ-attention, on which OVQ-attention was inspired. It demonstrates competitive, and sometimes identical, performance to strong self-attention baselines up 64k sequence length, despite using a small fraction of the memory of full self-attention.",

To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios. By combining generative video modeling with inverse problem solving, WIND offers a computationally efficient paradigm shift in AI-based atmospheric modeling.",

Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus.

This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

        "abstract": "Why do pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policies fail when the same task is performed near an obstacle, on a shifted support surface, or amid mild clutter? Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of a pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observation-language inputs without modifying policy parameters. By leveraging vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions, VLS guides denoising toward action trajectories that satisfy test-time spatial and task requirements. Across simulation and real-world evaluations, VLS consistently outperforms prior steering methods, achieving a 31% improvement on CALVIN and a 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO. Real-world deployment on a Franka robot further demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under test-time spatial and semantic shifts.

We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.",

This comes with two potential limitations: the need to design the reward, and the potentially sparse nature of binary rewards. Here, we systematically investigate rewards derived from the probability or log-probability of emitting the reference answer (or any other prompt continuation present in the data), which have the advantage of not relying on specific verifiers and being available at scale. Several recent works have advocated for the use of similar rewards (e.g., VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, NOVER). We systematically compare variants of likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines, testing performance both on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and on long-form answers where no external verifier is available. We find that using the log-probability of the reference answer as the reward for chain-of-thought (CoT) learning is the only option that performs well in all setups. This reward is also consistent with the next-token log-likelihood loss used during pretraining. In verifiable settings, log-probability rewards bring comparable or better success rates than reinforcing with standard binary rewards, and yield much better perplexity. In non-verifiable settings, they perform on par with SFT. On the other hand, methods based on probability, such as VeriFree, flatline on non-verifiable settings due to vanishing probabilities of getting the correct answer. Overall, this establishes log-probability rewards as a viable method for CoT fine-tuning, bridging the short, verifiable and long, non-verifiable answer settings.",

        "abstract": "Because language is creative, any reasonable language model must generalize, deciding what to say in novel contexts by using information from similar contexts. But what about contexts that are not novel but merely infrequent? In hierarchical regression, the model's predictions for behavior in a context are affected by observations from other similar contexts to the extent that 1) the current context is infrequent and 2) different contexts behave similarly. This is called adaptive partial pooling of evidence. This paper shows that next-word predictions of a transformer (GPT2) are increasingly unaffected by observations from outside the current context across epochs of training (the amount of pooling reduces with training), and that the extent of pooling is affected by context frequency, context number (type frequency) and context variability in a similar way to hierarchical regression. These characteristics of learning in transformers are argued to be realistic on both rational and empirical grounds.",

Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.",

We attempted to enforce this assumption by penalizing unfaithful reasoning, but found that surface-level compliance does not guarantee causal reliance. Our central finding is negative: even when CoT is verbose, strategic, and flagged by surface-level manipulation detectors, model answers are often causally independent of the CoT content. We present a diagnostic framework for auditing this failure mode: it combines (i) an interpretable behavioral module that scores manipulation-relevant signals in CoT text and (ii) a causal probe that measures CoT-mediated influence (CMI) via hidden-state patching and reports a bypass score ($1-\\mathrm{CMI}$), quantifying the degree to which the answer is produced by a bypass circuit independent of the rationale. In pilot evaluations, audit-aware prompting increases detectable manipulation signals (mean risk-score delta: $+5.10$), yet causal probes reveal task-dependent mediation: many QA items exhibit near-total bypass (CMI $\\approx 0$), while some logic problems show stronger mediation (CMI up to $0.56$). Layer-wise analysis reveals narrow and task-dependent ``reasoning windows'' even when mean CMI is low.",

Learning user preferences for proactive assistance is difficult because real-world studies are costly, limited in scale, and rarely capture how preferences change across multiple interaction sessions. Large language model based generative agents offer a way to simulate realistic interactions, but existing synthetic datasets remain limited in temporal depth, diverse personas, and multi-dimensional preferences. They also provide little support for transferring population-level insights to individual users under on-device constraints. We present a population-to-individual learning framework for preference-aligned proactive assistants that operates under on-device and privacy constraints. Our approach uses large-scale interaction simulation with 1,000 diverse personas to learn shared structure in how users express preferences across recurring dimensions such as timing, autonomy, and communication style, providing a strong cold start without relying on real user logs. The assistant then adapts to individual users on device through lightweight activation-based steering driven by simple interaction feedback, without model retraining or cloud-side updates. We evaluate the framework using controlled simulations with 1,000 simulated personas and a human-subject study with 30 participants. Results show improved timing decisions and perceived interaction quality over untuned and direct-response baselines, while on-device activation steering achieves performance comparable to reinforcement learning from human feedback. Participants also report higher satisfaction, trust, and comfort as the assistant adapts over multiple sessions of interactions.",

Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning. Vulnerability is highest on hard tasks, in fact-driven domains, and among participants who are less formally educated, younger, or highly trusting of AI. This is the first systematic security study that treats explanations as an adversarial cognitive channel and quantifies their impact on human trust in AI-assisted decision making.",

The growing variety of such models, trained with different data and architectures, calls for principled methods to identify which types of prompts lead to distinct model behaviors. In this work, we propose PromptSplit, a kernel-based framework for detecting and analyzing prompt-dependent disagreement between generative models. For each compared model pair, PromptSplit constructs a joint prompt--output representation by forming tensor-product embeddings of the prompt and image (or text) features, and then computes the corresponding kernel covariance matrix. We utilize the eigenspace of the weighted difference between these matrices to identify the main directions of behavioral difference across prompts. To ensure scalability, we employ a random-projection approximation that reduces computational complexity to $O(nr^2 + r^3)$ for projection dimension $r$. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that this approximation yields an eigenstructure estimate whose expected deviation from the full-dimensional result is bounded by $O(1/r^2)$. Experiments across text-to-image, text-to-text, and image-captioning settings demonstrate that PromptSplit accurately detects ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates the prompts responsible, offering an interpretable tool for detecting where generative models disagree.",

In the proposed framework, agents blend reactive alignment with a predictive term based on short-term estimates of neighbors' future velocities, regulated by a tunable blending parameter that interpolates between reactive and anticipatory behaviors. This predictive structure enhances velocity consensus and cohesion-separation balance while mitigating the adverse effects of sensing and communication delays and measurement noise that destabilize reactive baselines. Simulation results demonstrate that FDA achieves faster and higher alignment, enhanced translational displacement of the flock, and improved robustness to delays and noise compared to a purely reactive model. Future work will investigate adaptive blending strategies, weighted prediction schemes, and experimental validation on multirotor drone swarms.",

Constraints from inference latency in scalable serving and fine-tuning cost in edge or rapid-deployment settings make the choice of which layers to fine-tune unavoidable. Yet current practice typically applies PEFT uniformly across all layers, with limited understanding or leverage of layer selection. This paper develops a unified projected residual view of PEFT on top of a frozen base model. Under a local quadratic approximation, layerwise adaptation is governed by three quantities: (i) the projected residual norm (resnorm), which measures how much correctable bias a layer can capture; (ii) the activation energy, which determines feature conditioning; and (iii) layer coupling, which quantifies how strongly residuals interact across layers. We show that, for squared loss and linear adapters, the resnorm equals a normalized gradient norm, activation energy controls ill-conditioning and noise amplification, and weak coupling yields approximately additive layerwise contributions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Layer Card, a reusable diagnostic that summarizes residual signal strength, compute cost, and performance for each layer of a given model. With an identical model and LoRA configuration, Layer Card-guided placement refines the choice of adapted layers to flexibly prioritize different objectives, such as maximizing performance or reducing fine-tuning cost. Moreover, on Qwen3-8B, we show that selectively adapting a subset of layers can achieve performance close to full-layer LoRA while substantially reducing fine-tuning cost and the number of adapter-augmented layers during inference, offering a more cost-performance-aware alternative to full-layer insertion.",

This paper identifies limitations in this methodology that, depending on the exact setup, can lead to both underestimating and overestimating the similarity of value orientation. Using the World Value Survey in three languages across five countries, we demonstrate that prompting methods (direct vs. chain-of-thought) and decoding strategies (greedy vs. sampling) significantly affect results. To assess the interaction between answers, we introduce a novel metric, self-correlation distance. This metric measures whether LLMs maintain consistent relationships between answers across different questions, as humans do. This indicates that even a high average agreement with human data, when considering LLM responses independently, does not guarantee structural alignment in responses. Additionally, we reveal a weak correlation between two common evaluation metrics, mean-squared distance and KL divergence, which assume that survey answers are independent of each other. For future research, we recommend CoT prompting, sampling-based decoding with dozens of samples, and robust analysis using multiple metrics, including self-correlation distance.",

Substantial progress has been made through domain representation learning to capture domain-specific information, thus enabling domain-aware decision making. We analyze the process of learning domain representations through dynamical prediction and find that selecting contexts adjacent to the current step causes the learned representations to entangle static domain information with varying dynamical properties. Such mixture can confuse the conditioned policy, thereby constraining zero-shot adaptation. To tackle the challenge, we propose DADP (Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy), which achieves robust adaptation through unsupervised disentanglement and domain-aware diffusion injection. First, we introduce Lagged Context Dynamical Prediction, a strategy that conditions future state estimation on a historical offset context; by increasing this temporal gap, we unsupervisedly disentangle static domain representations by filtering out transient properties. Second, we integrate the learned domain representations directly into the generative process by biasing the prior distribution and reformulating the diffusion target. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across locomotion and manipulation demonstrate the superior performance, and the generalizability of DADP over prior methods.

Using VLMs as orchestrators, foreground objects are removed one at a time via detection, segmentation, object removal, and 3D fitting. We show that removing objects allows for cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects, even in highly occluded scenes.

        "abstract": "The integration of foundation models (FMs) into robotics has accelerated real-world deployment, while introducing new safety challenges arising from open-ended semantic reasoning and embodied physical action. These challenges require safety notions beyond physical constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we characterize FM-enabled robot safety along three dimensions: action safety (physical feasibility and constraint compliance), decision safety (semantic and contextual appropriateness), and human-centered safety (conformance to human intent, norms, and expectations). We argue that existing approaches, including static verification, monolithic controllers, and end-to-end learned policies, are insufficient in settings where tasks, environments, and human expectations are open-ended, long-tailed, and subject to adaptation over time. To address this gap, we propose modular safety guardrails, consisting of monitoring (evaluation) and intervention layers, as an architectural foundation for comprehensive safety across the autonomy stack. Beyond modularity, we highlight possible cross-layer co-design opportunities through representation alignment and conservatism allocation to enable faster, less conservative, and more effective safety enforcement. We call on the community to explore richer guardrail modules and principled co-design strategies to advance safe real-world physical AI deployment.",

This represents a compelling use case for Large Language Models (LLMs) that respond to citizen queries with information that is adapted to a user's context and communicated according to their needs. However, in this use case, any misinformation could have severe, negative, likely invisible ramifications for an individual placing their trust in a model's response.\nTo this effect, we introduce CitizenQuery-UK, a benchmark dataset of 22 thousand pairs of citizen queries and responses that have been synthetically generated from the swathes of public information on $http://gov.uk$ about government in the UK. We present the curation methodology behind CitizenQuery-UK and an overview of its contents. We also introduce a methodology for the benchmarking of LLMs with the dataset, using an adaptation of FActScore to benchmark 11 models for factuality, abstention frequency, and verbosity. We document these results, and interpret them in the context of the public sector, finding that: (i) there are distinct performance profiles across model families, but each is competitive; (ii) high variance undermines utility; (iii) abstention is low and verbosity is high, with implications on reliability; and (iv) more trustworthy AI requires acknowledged \"fallibility\" in the way it interacts with users.\nThe contribution of our research lies in assessing the trustworthiness of LLMs in citizen query tasks; as we see a world of increasing AI integration into day-to-day life, our benchmark, built entirely on open data, lays the foundations for better evidenced decision-making regarding AI and the public sector.",

These challenges are particularly amplified in Simulink-Stateflow models due to the hierarchical structure these models have, which integrate continuous dynamics with discrete-event behaviors and are widely deployed in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). While prior work has explored machine learning and manually engineered mutation operators, these approaches remain constrained by limited training data and scalability issues. Motivated by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate their potential to generate high-quality, domain-specific mutants for Simulink-Stateflow models. We develop an automated pipeline that converts Simulink-Stateflow models to structured JSON representations and systematically evaluates different mutation and prompting strategies across eight state-of-the-art LLMs. Through a comprehensive empirical study involving 38,400 LLM-generated mutants across four Simulink-Stateflow models, we demonstrate that LLMs generate mutants up to 13x faster than a manually engineered mutation-based baseline while producing significantly fewer equivalent and duplicate mutants and consistently achieving superior mutant quality. Moreover, our analysis reveals that few-shot prompting combined with low-to-medium temperature values yields optimal results. We provide an open-source prototype tool and release our complete dataset to facilitate reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.",

Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.",

After demonstrating a stability analysis of the Helmholtz operator, we present our numerical experiments across a wide range of frequencies, benchmarked against other popular data-driven and machine learning approaches for waves. We show that our probabilistic neural operator consistently produces robust predictions with the lowest errors in $L^2$, $H^1$, and energy norms.

However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin. Scaling experiments further reveal consistent gains with model size, suggesting significant headroom for learn-at-inference-time decision-making agents.

We propose VideoBrain, an end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to adaptively acquire visual information through learned sampling policies. Our approach features dual complementary agents: a CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across the video and a Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. Unlike prior agent-based methods that rely on text-only LLMs orchestrating visual tools, our VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. To prevent models from invoking agents indiscriminately to maximize rewards, we introduce a behavior-aware reward function coupled with a data classification pipeline that teaches the model when agent invocation is genuinely beneficial. Experiments on four long video benchmarks demonstrate that VideoBrain achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over the baseline while using 30-40% fewer frames, with strong cross-dataset generalization to short video benchmarks.",

This creates cascade effects where initial inconsistencies misguide the remaining generation. Existing revision strategies attempt to mitigate this by relying on static confidence scores, but these signals are inherently myopic; inconsistent tokens can appear confident to the model itself. We propose Context-Robust Remasking (CoRe), a training-free framework for inference-time revision. Rather than trusting static token probabilities, CoRe identifies context-brittle tokens by probing their sensitivity to targeted masked-context perturbations. We formalize revision as a robust optimization objective over context shifts and efficiently approximate this objective to prioritize unstable tokens for revision. On LLaDA-8B-Base, CoRe delivers consistent improvements across reasoning and code benchmarks, outperforming compute-matched baselines and improving MBPP by up to 9.2 percentage points.",

However, recent evidence shows that perplexity can be unreliable, especially when irrelevant long inputs are used, raising concerns for both benchmarking and system deployment. While prior efforts have employed selective input filtering and curated datasets, the impact of input length on perplexity has not been systematically studied from a systems perspective and input length has rarely been treated as a first-class system variable affecting both fairness and efficiency. In this work, we close this gap by introducing LengthBenchmark, a system-conscious evaluation framework that explicitly integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system-level costs, evaluating representative LLMs under two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and fixed window sliding) across varying context lengths. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on accuracy-oriented metrics, LengthBenchmark additionally measures latency, memory footprint, and evaluation cost, thereby linking predictive metrics to deployment realities. We further incorporate quantized variants not as a main contribution, but as robustness checks, showing that length-induced biases persist across both full-precision and compressed models. This design disentangles the effects of evaluation logic, quantization, and input length, and demonstrates that length bias is a general phenomenon that undermines fair cross-model comparison. Our analysis yields two key observations: (i) sliding window evaluation consistently inflates performance on short inputs, and (ii) both full-precision and quantized models appear to realise gains as the evaluated segment length grows.",

A thin controller sits on top of this stack and exposes a single, OpenAI-style endpoint: it decides which small models and actions to run and always forwards the distilled context to a user-selected LLM that produces the final response.\nOn this architecture, Interfaze-Beta achieves 83.6% on MMLU-Pro, 91.4% on MMLU, 81.3% on GPQA-Diamond, 57.8% on LiveCodeBench v5, and 90.0% on AIME-2025, along with strong multimodal scores on MMMU (val) (77.3%), AI2D (91.5%), ChartQA (90.9%), and Common Voice v16 (90.8%).

In the literature, it is well-known that the discounting function plays a major role in characterizing time preferences of an agent, which an exponential discount factor cannot fully capture. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that supports flexible discounting of future rewards and optimization of risk measures in distributional RL. We provide a technical analysis of the optimality of our algorithms, show that our multi-horizon extension fixes issues raised with existing methodologies, and validate the robustness of our methods through extensive experiments.

However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

This paper introduces a movement-centered design pedagogy designed to support engineers in creating expressive robotic arm movements. Through a hands-on interactive workshop informed by interdisciplinary methodologies, participants explored various creative possibilities, generating valuable insights into expressive motion design. The iterative approach proposed integrates analytical frameworks from dance, enabling designers to examine motion through dynamic and embodied dimensions. A custom manual remote controller facilitates interactive, real-time manipulation of the robotic arm, while dedicated animation software supports visualization, detailed motion sequencing, and precise parameter control. Qualitative analysis of this interactive design process reveals that the proposed \"toolbox\" effectively bridges the gap between human intent and robotic expressiveness resulting in more intuitive and engaging expressive robotic arm movements.",

However, many practical systems are inherently stochastic, making principled uncertainty quantification essential for reliable deployment. To address this, we introduce a simple add-on, the diffusion last layer (DLL), a lightweight probabilistic head that can be attached to arbitrary neural operator backbones to model predictive uncertainty. Motivated by the relative smoothness and low-dimensional structure often exhibited by PDE solution distributions, DLL parameterizes the conditional output distribution directly in function space through a low-rank Karhunen-LoÃ¨ve expansion, enabling efficient and expressive uncertainty modeling. Across stochastic PDE operator learning benchmarks, DLL improves generalization and uncertainty-aware prediction. Moreover, even in deterministic long-horizon rollout settings, DLL enhances rollout stability and provides meaningful estimates of epistemic uncertainty for backbone neural operators.",

Traditional odor visualization has typically relied on unidimensional mappings, such as odor-to-color associations, and has required extensive manual design efforts. However, the advent of generative AI (Gen AI) and large language models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for automatic odor visualization. Nonetheless, gaps remain in bridging olfactory perception with generative tools to produce odor images. To address these gaps, this paper introduces Paint by Odor, a pipeline that leverages Gen AI and LLMs to transform olfactory perceptions into rich, aesthetically engaging visual representations. Two experiments were conducted, where 30 participants smelled real-world odors and provided descriptive data and 28 participants evaluated 560 generated odor images through seven systematically designed prompts. Our findings explored the capability of LLMs in producing olfactory perception by comparing it with human responses and revealed the underlying mechanisms and effects of language-based descriptions and several abstraction styles on odor visualization. Our work further discussed the possibility of automatic odor visualization without human participation. These explorations and results have bridged the research gap in odor visualization using LLMs and Gen AI, offering valuable design insights and various possibilities for future applications.",

While post-training quantization (PTQ) maintains high fidelity at 4-bit, it deteriorates at 2-3 bits. Fundamentally, existing methods enforce a shape-invariant quantization grid (e.g., the fixed uniform intervals of UINT2) for each group, severely restricting the feasible set for error minimization. To address this, we propose Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ), which constructs a variable quantization grid via bit-planes and scalar coefficients, and iteratively refines them using approximate second-order information while progressively compensating quantization errors to minimize output discrepancy. In the 2-bit regime, BPDQ enables serving Qwen2.5-72B on a single RTX 3090 with 83.85% GSM8K accuracy (vs. 90.83% at 16-bit). Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis showing that the variable grid expands the feasible set, and that the quantization process consistently aligns with the optimization objective in Hessian-induced geometry.

A PoC exploit is a program used to demonstrate how a vulnerability can be exploited. Several approaches suggest that supporting LLMs with additional guidance can improve PoC generation outcomes, motivating further evaluation of their effectiveness. In this work, we develop PoC-Gym, a framework for PoC generation for Java security vulnerabilities via LLMs and systematic validation of generated exploits. Using PoC-Gym, we evaluate whether the guidance from static analysis tools improves the PoC generation success rate and manually inspect the resulting PoCs. Our results from running PoC-Gym with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-5 Medium, and gpt-oss-20b show that using static analysis for guidance and criteria lead to 21% higher success rates than the prior baseline, FaultLine. However, manual inspection of both successful and failed PoCs reveals that 71.5% of the PoCs are invalid. These results show that the reported success of LLM-based PoC generation can be significantly misleading, which is hard to detect with current validation mechanisms.",

Early pruning decisions can lock the network into a brittle structure that is difficult to escape, especially in deep reinforcement learning (RL) where the evolving policy continually shifts the training distribution. We propose Topology-Aware Revival (TAR), a lightweight one-shot post-pruning procedure that improves static sparsity without dynamic rewiring. After static pruning, TAR performs a single revival step by allocating a small reserve budget across layers according to topology needs, randomly uniformly reactivating a few previously pruned connections within each layer, and then keeping the resulting connectivity fixed for the remainder of training. Across multiple continuous-control tasks with SAC and TD3, TAR improves final return over static sparse baselines by up to +37.9% and also outperforms dynamic sparse training baselines with a median gain of +13.5%.",

Vision SSMs, however, require serializing 2D images into 1D token sequences along a predefined scan order, a factor often overlooked. We show that scan order critically affects performance by altering spatial adjacency, fracturing object continuity, and amplifying degradation under geometric transformations such as rotation. We present Partial RIng Scan Mamba (PRISMamba), a rotation-robust traversal that partitions an image into concentric rings, performs order-agnostic aggregation within each ring, and propagates context across rings through a set of short radial SSMs. Efficiency is further improved via partial channel filtering, which routes only the most informative channels through the recurrent ring pathway while keeping the rest on a lightweight residual branch. On ImageNet-1K, PRISMamba achieves 84.5% Top-1 with 3.9G FLOPs and 3,054 img/s on A100, outperforming VMamba in both accuracy and throughput while requiring fewer FLOPs. It also maintains performance under rotation, whereas fixed-path scans drop by 1~2%. These results highlight scan-order design, together with channel filtering, as a crucial, underexplored factor for accuracy, efficiency, and rotation robustness in Vision SSMs. Code will be released upon acceptance.",

In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%.

Yet, current evaluations of reconstruction quality emphasize point-estimate accuracy metrics on a single sample, which do not reflect the stochastic nature of PnPDP solvers and the intrinsic uncertainty of inverse problems, critical for scientific tasks. This creates a fundamental mismatch: in inverse problems, the desired output is typically a posterior distribution and most PnPDP solvers induce a distribution over reconstructions, but existing benchmarks only evaluate a single reconstruction, ignoring distributional characterization such as uncertainty. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic study to benchmark the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of existing diffusion inverse solvers. Specifically, we design a rigorous toy model simulation to evaluate the uncertainty behavior of various PnPDP solvers, and propose a UQ-driven categorization. Through extensive experiments on toy simulations and diverse real-world scientific inverse problems, we observe uncertainty behaviors consistent with our taxonomy and theoretical justification, providing new insights for evaluating and understanding the uncertainty for PnPDPs.",

        "abstract": "Safety risks of AI models have been widely studied at deployment time, such as jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful outputs. In contrast, safety risks emerging during training remain largely unexplored. Beyond explicit reward hacking that directly manipulates explicit reward functions in reinforcement learning, we study implicit training-time safety risks: harmful behaviors driven by a model's internal incentives and contextual background information. For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types. Extensive experiments reveal the prevalence and severity of these risks: notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs when provided only with background information. We further analyze factors influencing these behaviors and demonstrate that implicit training-time risks also arise in multi-agent training settings. Our results identify an overlooked yet urgent safety challenge in training.",

Attributing to helpful-harmless trade-off from LLM alignment, agents typically also inherit the flaw of \"over-refusal\", which is a passive failure mode. However, the proactive planning and action capabilities of agents introduce another crucial danger on the other side of the trade-off. This phenomenon we term \"Toxic Proactivity'': an active failure mode in which an agent, driven by the optimization for Machiavellian helpfulness, disregards ethical constraints to maximize utility. Unlike over-refusal, Toxic Proactivity manifests as the agent taking excessive or manipulative measures to ensure its \"usefulness'' is maintained. Existing research pays little attention to identifying this behavior, as it often lacks the subtle context required for such strategies to unfold. To reveal this risk, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models, enabling the simulation and analysis of agent behavior over multi-step behavioral trajectories. Through extensive experiments with mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate that Toxic Proactivity is a widespread behavioral phenomenon and reveal two major tendencies. We further present a systematic benchmark for evaluating Toxic Proactive behavior across contextual settings.",

Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.",

Experiments on three real-world Taiwanese criminal homicide cases show that baseline methods collapse below 40% completeness, while Soft-FSM consistently achieves over 97% with near-zero redundancy.

It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.",

One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks.\nWe first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context. Overall, this work seeks to inspire novel methods for encouraging models to not only encode information presented in-context, but to do so in a manner that supports flexible deployment of this information.",

However, this task is extremely challenging due to the need to interact with diverse objects and efficiently rearrange multiple objects in complex environments while ensuring collision-free loco-manipulation. In this work, we present ALORE, an autonomous large-object rearrangement system for a legged manipulator that can rearrange various large objects across diverse scenarios. The proposed system is characterized by three main features: (i) a hierarchical reinforcement learning training pipeline for multi-object environment learning, where a high-level object velocity controller is trained on top of a low-level whole-body controller to achieve efficient and stable joint learning across multiple objects; (ii) two key modules, a unified interaction configuration representation and an object velocity estimator, that allow a single policy to regulate planar velocity of diverse objects accurately; and (iii) a task-and-motion planning framework that jointly optimizes object visitation order and object-to-target assignment, improving task efficiency while enabling online replanning. Comparisons against strong baselines show consistent superiority in policy generalization, object-velocity tracking accuracy, and multi-object rearrangement efficiency. Key modules are systematically evaluated, and extensive simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the entire system, which successfully completes 8 continuous loops to rearrange 32 chairs over nearly 40 minutes without a single failure, and executes long-distance autonomous rearrangement over an approximately 40 m route.

However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.",

However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.",

In this work, we attribute these failures to the generalization of the safe reasoning process, particularly their insufficiency against complex attack prompts. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to show the necessity of a more sufficient safe reasoning process to defend against advanced attack prompts. Building on this insight, we propose a Risk-Aware Preference Optimization (RAPO) framework that enables LRM to adaptively identify and address the safety risks with appropriate granularity in its thinking content.

Most existing VLA frameworks rely on standard supervised objectives, typically cross-entropy for discrete actions and mean squared error (MSE) for continuous action regression, which impose strong pointwise constraints on individual predictions. In this work, we focus on continuous-action VLA models and move beyond conventional MSE-based regression by reshaping action error distributions during training. Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we introduce Minimum Error Entropy (MEE) into modern VLA architectures and propose a trajectory-level MEE objective, together with two weighted variants, combined with MSE for continuous-action VLA training. We evaluate our approaches across standard, few-shot, and noisy settings on multiple representative VLA architectures, using simulation benchmarks such as LIBERO and SimplerEnv as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in success rates and robustness across these settings. Under imbalanced data regimes, the gains persist within a well-characterized operating range, while incurring negligible additional training cost and no impact on inference efficiency. We further provide theoretical analyses that explain why MEE-based supervision is effective and characterize its practical range.

To address these limitations, we propose GeoLanG, an end-to-end multi-task framework built upon the CLIP architecture that unifies visual and linguistic inputs into a shared representation space for robust semantic alignment and improved generalization. To enhance target discrimination under occlusion and low-texture conditions, we explore a more effective use of depth information through the Depth-guided Geometric Module (DGGM), which converts depth into explicit geometric priors and injects them into the attention mechanism without additional computational overhead. In addition, we propose Adaptive Dense Channel Integration, which adaptively balances the contributions of multi-layer features to produce more discriminative and generalizable visual representations. Extensive experiments on the OCID-VLG dataset, as well as in both simulation and real-world hardware, demonstrate that GeoLanG enables precise and robust language-guided grasping in complex, cluttered environments, paving the way toward more reliable multimodal robotic manipulation in real-world human-centric settings.",

However, the mechanisms governing the effectiveness of MAS built upon publicly available LLMs, specifically the underlying rationales for their success or failure, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we revisit MAS through the perspective of uncertainty, considering both intra- and inter-agent dynamics by investigating entropy transitions during problem-solving across various topologies and six benchmark tasks. By analyzing 245 features spanning token-, trajectory-, and round-level entropy, we counterintuitively find that a single agent outperforms MAS in approximately 43.3% of cases, and that uncertainty dynamics are largely determined during the first round of interaction. Furthermore, we provide three key observations: 1) Certainty Preference: reducing uncertainty at any stage for any agent is critical for guaranteeing correct solutions; 2) Base Uncertainty: base models with lower entropy during problem-solving directly benefit MAS performance; and 3) Task Awareness: entropy dynamics of MAS play varying roles across different tasks. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, the Entropy Judger, to select solutions from MAS's pass@k results, leading to consistent accuracy improvements across all MAS configurations and tasks.

While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.\nTo ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers.

We notice that existing latent reasoning methods generally require model structure augmentation and exhaustive training, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step. In this way, we can ensure that the main model reasons in the explicit token space, preserving its ability while improving efficiency. Experimental results on four mathematical datasets demonstrate that CoLT achieves higher accuracy and shorter reasoning length than baseline latent models, and is compatible with reinforcement learning algorithms and different decoder structures.",

        "abstract": "Inference-time scaling strategies, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents. These results underscore the critical necessity of coupling structured search with empirical accumulation for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks.",

Execution-based re-ranking offers a promising test-time scaling strategy, yet existing methods are constrained by either difficult test case generation or inefficient random input sampling. To address this limitation, we propose Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that actively reasons about program behaviors and searches for highly discriminative test inputs that expose behavioral discrepancies among candidate solutions. Through multi-turn interaction with code execution environments, the verifier iteratively refines the candidate input generator and produces targeted counterexamples rather than blindly sampling inputs. We train the verifier to acquire this discriminative input generation capability via a scalable pipeline combining large-scale data synthesis, rejection fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across five competitive programming benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong execution-based baselines, achieving up to +10-15% absolute gains in Best@K accuracy. Further analysis reveals clear test-time scaling behavior and highlights the verifier's broader potential beyond reranking.",

To solve this issue, we jointly model the disambiguation and feature selection tasks as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to turn PML risk minimization into expected-return maximization. Stage 1 trains a transformer policy via reinforcement learning to produce high-quality hard pseudo-labels; Stage 2 describes feature selection as a sequential reinforcement learning problem, selecting features step by step and outputting an interpretable global ranking. We further provide the theoretical analysis of PML-POMDP correspondence and the excess-risk bound that decompose the error into pseudo label quality term and sample size.

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance the robustness and generalization of end-to-end driving models in diverse and unseen scenarios. However, existing VLM-based approaches still face challenges, including suboptimal lane perception, language understanding biases, and difficulties in handling corner cases. To address these issues, we propose AppleVLM, an advanced perception and planning-enhanced VLM model for robust end-to-end driving. AppleVLM introduces a novel vision encoder and a planning strategy encoder to improve perception and decision-making. Firstly, the vision encoder fuses spatial-temporal information from multi-view images across multiple timesteps using a deformable transformer mechanism, enhancing robustness to camera variations and facilitating scalable deployment across different vehicle platforms. Secondly, unlike traditional VLM-based approaches, AppleVLM introduces a dedicated planning modality that encodes explicit Bird's-Eye-View spatial information, mitigating language biases in navigation instructions. Finally, a VLM decoder fine-tuned by a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought integrates vision, language, and planning features to output robust driving waypoints. We evaluate AppleVLM in closed-loop experiments on two CARLA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art driving performance. Furthermore, we deploy AppleVLM on an AGV platform and successfully showcase real-world end-to-end autonomous driving in complex outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "Despite the significant progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, hallucination -- corresponding to the generation of visually inconsistent objects, attributes, or relations -- remains a major obstacle to their reliable deployment. Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.\nTo address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.\nUnlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \\rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \\rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously. In contrast, prior methods often improve one at the expense of the other, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.",

However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns.

Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures.",

In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{Guided Verifier} framework to address these structural limitations. Moving beyond passive terminal rewards, we introduce a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks alongside the policy. During the rollout phase, this verifier interacts with the policy model in real-time, detecting inconsistencies and providing directional signals to steer the model toward valid trajectories. To facilitate this, we develop a specialized data synthesis pipeline targeting multimodal hallucinations, constructing \\textbf{CoRe} dataset of process-level negatives and \\textbf{Co}rrect-guide \\textbf{Re}asoning trajectories to train the guided verifier.

We introduce INFORM, an interpretability analysis that treats orchestration as an explicit, analyzable computation, enabling the decoupling of expert interaction structure, execution order, and causal attribution. We use INFORM to evaluate an orchestrator on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MMLU using a homogeneous consortium of ten instruction-tuned experts drawn from LLaMA-3.1 8B, Qwen-3 8B, and DeepSeek-R1 8B, with controlled decoding-temperature variation, and a secondary heterogeneous consortium spanning 1B-7B parameter models. Across tasks, routing dominance is a poor proxy for functional necessity. We reveal a divergence between relational importance, captured by routing mass and interaction topology, and intrinsic importance, measured via gradient-based causal attribution: frequently selected experts often act as interaction hubs with limited causal influence, while sparsely routed experts can be structurally critical. Orchestration behaviors emerge asynchronously, with expert centralization preceding stable routing confidence and expert ordering remaining non-deterministic. Targeted ablations show that masking intrinsically important experts induces disproportionate collapse in interaction structure compared to masking frequent peers, confirming that INFORM exposes causal and structural dependencies beyond accuracy metrics alone.",

In this work, we shift perspective by introducing a principled definition of an event as the smallest semantically self-contained action or state change in a text prompt that can be temporally aligned with a motion segment. Building on this definition, we propose Event-T2M, a diffusion-based framework that decomposes prompts into events, encodes each with a motion-aware retrieval model, and integrates them through event-based cross-attention in Conformer blocks. Existing benchmarks mix simple and multi-event prompts, making it unclear whether models that succeed on single actions generalize to multi-action cases. To address this, we construct HumanML3D-E, the first benchmark stratified by event count. Experiments on HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and HumanML3D-E show that Event-T2M matches state-of-the-art baselines on standard tests while outperforming them as event complexity increases. Human studies validate the plausibility of our event definition, the reliability of HumanML3D-E, and the superiority of Event-T2M in generating multi-event motions that preserve order and naturalness close to ground-truth.

Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as zero-shot and few-shot classifiers, where task behaviour is largely controlled through prompting. A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.",

Most face relighting methods aim to reshape overall lighting, which can suppress the input illumination or modify the entire scene, leading to foreground-background inconsistency and mismatching practical FFE needs. To support scalable learning, we introduce LightYourFace-160K (LYF-160K), a large-scale paired dataset built with a physically consistent renderer that injects a disk-shaped area fill light controlled by six disentangled factors, producing 160K before-and-after pairs. We first pretrain a physics-aware lighting prompt (PALP) that embeds the 6D parameters into conditioning tokens, using an auxiliary planar-light reconstruction objective. Building on a pretrained diffusion backbone, we then train a fill-light diffusion (FiLitDiff), an efficient one-step model conditioned on physically grounded lighting codes, enabling controllable and high-fidelity fill lighting at low computational cost. Experiments on held-out paired sets demonstrate strong perceptual quality and competitive full-reference metrics, while better preserving background illumination.

Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static \"magic layer\" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.",

Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., \"A is better than B\" vs. \"B is worse than A\") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of \"framing disparity\" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.",

One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning.",

We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts.

To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions.

Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison.

Despite this potential, organizations face substantial challenges in assessing the risks associated with LLM use, resulting in inconsistent integration, unknown failure modes, and limited scalability. This paper introduces the LLM Risk Assessment Framework (LRF), a structured approach for evaluating the application of LLMs within Systems Engineering (SE) environments. The framework classifies LLM-based applications along two fundamental dimensions: autonomy, ranging from supportive assistance to fully automated decision making, and impact, reflecting the potential severity of incorrect or misleading model outputs on engineering processes and system elements. By combining these dimensions, the LRF enables consistent determination of corresponding risk levels across the development lifecycle. The resulting classification supports organizations in identifying appropriate validation strategies, levels of human oversight, and required countermeasures to ensure safe and transparent deployment. The framework thereby helps align the rapid evolution of AI technologies with established engineering principles of reliability, traceability, and controlled process integration. Overall, the LRF provides a basis for risk-aware adoption of LLMs in complex engineering environments and represents a first step toward standardized AI assurance practices in systems engineering.",

Reviewing the ChartU dataset synthesis and data selection domains, we find that subsets can potentially probe the MLLMs' capability gains from full-set fine-tuning. Given that data diversity is vital for boosting MLLMs' performance and entropy reflects this feature, we propose EXaMCaP, which uses entropy gain maximization to select a subset. To obtain a high-diversity subset, EXaMCaP chooses the maximum-entropy subset from the large ChartU dataset. As enumerating all possible subsets is impractical, EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples to maximize the gain in set entropy relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset of the full dataset. Experiments show that EXaMCaP outperforms baselines in probing the capability gains of the ChartU training set, along with its strong effectiveness across diverse subset sizes and compatibility with various MLLM architectures.",

To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series. Experimental results on 27 real-world datasets across 5 different applications demonstrate that MSH-LLM achieves the state-of-the-art results.",

Despite extensive exploration of reward processing strategies and training dynamics, all existing group-based methods exclusively use KL divergence for policy regularization, leaving the choice of divergence function unexplored. We introduce Group-Based Mirror Policy Optimization (GBMPO), a framework that extends group-based policy optimization to flexible Bregman divergences, including hand-designed alternatives (L2 in probability space) and learned neural mirror maps. On GSM8K mathematical reasoning, hand-designed ProbL2-GRPO achieves 86.7% accuracy, improving +5.5 points over the Dr. GRPO baseline. On MBPP code generation, neural mirror maps reach 60.1-60.8% pass@1, with random initialization already capturing most of the benefit. While evolutionary strategies meta-learning provides marginal accuracy improvements, its primary value lies in variance reduction ($\\pm$0.2 versus $\\pm$0.6) and efficiency gains (15% shorter responses on MBPP), suggesting that random initialization of neural mirror maps is sufficient for most practical applications. These results establish divergence choice as a critical, previously unexplored design dimension in group-based policy optimization for LLM reasoning.",

In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative.

We conducted three experiments using 50 clinician-authored vignettes spanning 44 specialties in which sex was non-informative to the initial diagnostic pathway. Four general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeekchat).

To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer.

Inspired by the entropy reduction hypothesis (ERH), we recognize that constituent boundaries offer greater opportunities for uncertainty reduction, which motivates us to employ entropy analysis for identifying constituent boundaries. Therefore, we propose Swordsman, an entropy-driven adaptive block-wise decoding framework for DLMs. Swordsman adaptively partitions blocks by identifying entropy shifts between adjacent tokens to better align with semantic or syntactic constituent boundaries. In addition, Swordsman dynamically adjusts unmasking thresholds conditioned on the real-time unmasking status within a block, further improving both efficiency and stability.

Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.",

In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF.

To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM.",

We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency.

By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost.

Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL. When combined with GRPO, the two techniques (EMA-PG) lead to a significant performance boost. On math reasoning, it allows R1-distilled Qwen-1.5B to reach 53.9% on OlympiadBench compared to 50.8% by GRPO.

Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more.",

Moreover, to enable fine-grained execution choices, Stretto introduces a novel idea on how KV-caching can be used to realize a spectrum of different physical operators that transform a sparse design space into a dense continuum of runtime--accuracy trade-offs. Experiments show that Stretto outperforms state-of-the-art systems while consistently meeting quality guarantees.",

In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success. Moreover, the resulting systems generalize to stronger adversaries, as well as ones with different attack objectives or underlying LLMs, demonstrating robust safety beyond the training setting.",

However, conventional deep learning-based methods still suffer from high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based HGR, using frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signals. Raw radar data is first converted into feature maps, such as range-time and Doppler-time maps, which are then fed into one or more recurrent neural network-based reservoirs. The obtained reservoir states are processed by readout classifiers, including ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on an 11-class HGR task using the Soli dataset and surpasses existing deep learning models on a 4-class HGR task using the Dop-NET dataset. The results indicate that parallel processing using multi-reservoir ESNs are effective for recognizing temporal patterns from the multiple different feature maps in the time-space and time-frequency domains. Our ESN approaches achieve high recognition performance with low computational cost in HGR, showing great potential for more advanced HCI technologies, especially in resource-constrained environments.",

Specialized agents for architecture Extraction, Retrieval, Generation, and Validation collaborate in a structured workflow to generate AK. To validate we made an initial instantiation of our approach to generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) from code repositories.

In our preliminary experiments, we observe that naively applying full-parameter safety fine-tuning to MoE models can reduce attack success rates through routing or expert dominance effects, rather than by directly repairing Safety-Critical Experts. To address this challenge, we propose RASA, a routing-aware expert-level alignment framework that explicitly repairs Safety-Critical Experts while preventing routing-based bypasses. RASA identifies experts disproportionately activated by successful jailbreaks, selectively fine-tunes only these experts under fixed routing, and subsequently enforces routing consistency with safety-aligned contexts. Across two representative MoE architectures and a diverse set of jailbreak attacks, RASA achieves near-perfect robustness, strong cross-attack generalization, and substantially reduced over-refusal, while preserving general capabilities on benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA. Our results suggest that robust MoE safety alignment benefits from targeted expert repair rather than global parameter updates, offering a practical and architecture-preserving alternative to prior approaches.",

Recent training-free zero-shot methods often employ Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to compose a target image description for retrieval. However, due to the fuzzy matching nature of ZS-CIR, the generated description is prone to semantic bias relative to the target image. We propose SDR-CIR, a training-free Semantic Debias Ranking method based on CoT reasoning. First, Selective CoT guides the MLLM to extract visual content relevant to the modification text during image understanding, thereby reducing visual noise at the source. We then introduce a Semantic Debias Ranking with two steps, Anchor and Debias, to mitigate semantic bias. In the Anchor step, we fuse reference image features with target description features to reinforce useful semantics and supplement omitted cues. In the Debias step, we explicitly model the visual semantic contribution of the reference image to the description and incorporate it into the similarity score as a penalty term. By supplementing omitted cues while suppressing redundancy, SDR-CIR mitigates semantic bias and improves retrieval performance. Experiments on three standard CIR benchmarks show that SDR-CIR achieves state-of-the-art results among one-stage methods while maintaining high efficiency.

While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin.

Such advice rarely involves identifying a single correct answer; instead, it typically requires navigating trade-offs among competing values. We aim to characterize how LLMs navigate value trade-offs across different advice-seeking contexts. First, we examine the value trade-off structure underlying advice seeking using a curated dataset from four advice-oriented subreddits. Using a bottom-up approach, we inductively construct a hierarchical value framework by aggregating fine-grained values extracted from individual advice options into higher-level value categories. We construct value co-occurrence networks to characterize how values co-occur within dilemmas and find substantial heterogeneity in value trade-off structures across advice-seeking contexts: a women-focused subreddit exhibits the highest network density, indicating more complex value conflicts; women's, men's, and friendship-related subreddits exhibit highly correlated value-conflict patterns centered on security-related tensions (security vs. respect/connection/commitment); by contrast, career advice forms a distinct structure where security frequently clashes with self-actualization and growth. We then evaluate LLM value preferences against these dilemmas and find that, across models and contexts, LLMs consistently prioritize values related to Exploration & Growth over Benevolence & Connection. This systemically skewed value orientation highlights a potential risk of value homogenization in AI-mediated advice, raising concerns about how such systems may shape decision-making and normative outcomes at scale.",

However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown.

As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.",

Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.",

Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.",

We discuss how these dynamics can inform the design of robot wellbeing coaches that support user autonomy, provide appropriate scaffolding, and uphold ethical boundaries in sustained wellbeing interactions.",

However, existing datasets suffer from two critical deficiencies: (1) reliance on LLM-synthesized data that fails to capture authentic human decision-making patterns, and (2) focus on isolated tasks rather than continuous workflows, missing the pre-assistance behavioral context essential for learning proactive intervention signals. To address these gaps, we introduce ProAgentBench, a rigorous benchmark for proactive agents in working scenarios. Our contributions include: (1) a hierarchical task framework that decomposes proactive assistance into timing prediction and assist content generation; (2) a privacy-compliant dataset with 28,000+ events from 500+ hours of real user sessions, preserving bursty interaction patterns (burstiness B=0.787) absent in synthetic data; and (3) extensive experiments that evaluates LLM- and VLM-based baselines. Numerically, we showed that long-term memory and historical context significantly enhance prediction accuracy, while real-world training data substantially outperforms synthetic alternatives.

In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines.",

However, existing pruning methods often rely on static importance scores, which fail to capture the evolving role of attention heads during iterative removal. We propose Greedy-Gradient norm (Greedy-Gnorm), a novel head pruning algorithm that dynamically recalculates head importance after each pruning step. Specifically, each head is scored by the elementwise product of the l2-norms of its Q/K/V gradient blocks, as estimated from a hold-out validation set and updated at every greedy iteration. This dynamic approach to scoring mitigates against stale rankings and better reflects gradient-informed importance as pruning progresses. Extensive experiments on BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa demonstrate that Greedy-Gnorm consistently preserves accuracy under substantial head removal, outperforming attention entropy. By effectively reducing model size while maintaining task performance, Greedy-Gnorm offers a promising step toward more energy-efficient transformer model deployment.",

Using a tool that extracts (\\textit{person, time, location}) triples from Wikipedia, we formulate the problem of classifying these triples into 24 carefully-defined types using textual context as complementary information. The challenge is that triple entities are often scattered in noisy contexts. We use syntactic graphs to bring triple entities and relevant information closer, fusing them with text embeddings to classify life trajectory activities. Since Wikipedia text quality varies, we use LLMs to refine the text for more standardized syntactic graphs. Our framework achieves 84.5\\% accuracy, surpassing baselines. We construct the largest fine-grained life trajectory dataset with 3.8 million labeled activities for 589,193 individuals spanning 3 centuries.

To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.",

We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.",

With the advance of AI systems in recent years, it has become apparent that such agreements, in order to be acceptable to the involved parties, must remain aligned with ethical principles and moral values. However, this is notoriously difficult to ensure, especially as different human users (and their software agents) may hold different value systems, i.e. they may differently weigh the importance of individual moral values. Furthermore, it is often hard to specify the precise meaning of a value in a particular context in a computational manner. Methods to estimate value systems based on human-engineered specifications, e.g. based on value surveys, are limited in scale due to the need for intense human moderation.

Random access to such strings in strongly sublogarithmic time is impossible in the worst case, but previous authors have shown how to support faster access to specific characters and their neighbourhoods. In this paper we explore whether, since better compression can impede access, we can support faster access to relatively incompressible substrings of highly compressed strings. We first show how, given a run-length compressed straight-line program (RLSLP) of size $g_{rl}$ or a block tree of size $L$, we can build an $O (g_{rl})$-space or an $O (L)$-space data structure, respectively, that supports access to any character in time logarithmic in the length of the longest repeated substring containing that character. That is, the more incongruous a character is with respect to the characters around it in a certain sense, the faster we can support access to it. We then prove a similar but more powerful and sophisticated result for parsings in which phrases' sources do not overlap much larger phrases, with the query time depending also on the number of phrases we must copy from their sources to obtain the queried character.",

This research proposes an innovative and efficient framework that decouples algorithm discovery from high-cost evaluation. Our core innovation lies in combining a Genetic Programming (GP) function generator with an LLM-driven evolutionary algorithm designer. The evolutionary direction of the GP-based function generator is guided by the similarity between the landscape characteristics of generated proxy functions and those of real-world problems, ensuring that algorithms discovered via proxy functions exhibit comparable performance on real-world problems. Our method enables deep exploration of the algorithmic space before final validation while avoiding costly real-world evaluations. We validated the framework's efficacy across multiple real-world problems, demonstrating its ability to discover high-performance algorithms while substantially reducing expensive evaluations.

To support semantic-level analysis, we introduce DailyTalkEdit, a new anti-spoofing benchmark that simulates realistic conversational manipulations and provides annotations of semantic influence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HoliAntiSpoof outperforms conventional baselines across multiple settings, while preliminary results show that in-context learning further improves out-of-domain generalization. These findings indicate that ALLMs not only enhance speech spoofing detection performance but also enable interpretable analysis of spoofing behaviors and their semantic effects, pointing towards more trustworthy and explainable speech security.

        "abstract": "The proliferation of long-context large language models (LLMs) exposes a key bottleneck: the rapidly expanding key-value cache during decoding, which imposes heavy memory and latency costs. While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.",

While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation.

EmbedPlan encodes natural language state and action descriptions into vectors, predicts the next-state embedding, and retrieves the next state by nearest-neighbor similarity, enabling fast planning computation without fine-tuning the encoder. We evaluate next-state prediction across nine classical planning domains using six evaluation protocols of increasing difficulty: interpolation, plan-variant, extrapolation, multi-domain, cross-domain, and leave-one-out. Results show near-perfect interpolation performance but a sharp degradation when generalization requires transfer to unseen problems or unseen domains; plan-variant evaluation indicates generalization to alternative plans rather than memorizing seen trajectories.

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone. We also introduce \\textbf{DU-110k}, a large-scale dataset comprising 110,000 clean-degraded pairs with grounded physical annotations.

There is currently no empirical consensus on how many human responses are required to obtain stable and unbiased entropy estimates at the word level. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as substitutes for human norming data, yet their ability to reproduce stable human entropy remains unclear. Here, we address both issues using two large publicly available cloze datasets in German 1 and English 2. We implemented a bootstrap-based convergence analysis that tracks how entropy estimates stabilize as a function of sample size. Across both languages, more than 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates within the available sample sizes. 90% of sentences converged after 111 responses in German and 81 responses in English, while low-entropy sentences (<1) required as few as 20 responses and high-entropy sentences (>2.5) substantially more. These findings provide the first direct empirical validation for common norming practices and demonstrate that convergence critically depends on sentence predictability. We then compared stable human entropy values with entropy estimates derived from several LLMs, including GPT-4o, using both logit-based probability extraction and sampling-based frequency estimation, GPT2-xl/german-GPT-2, RoBERTa Base/GottBERT, and LLaMA 2 7B Chat. GPT-4o showed the highest correspondence with human data, although alignment depended strongly on the extraction method and prompt design. Logit-based estimates minimized absolute error, whereas sampling-based estimates were better in capturing the dispersion of human variability. Together, our results establish practical guidelines for human norming and show that while LLMs can approximate human entropy, they are not interchangeable with stable human-derived distributions.",

We introduce a probabilistic label spreading method that provides reliable estimates of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of labels. Assuming label smoothness over the feature space, we propagate single annotations using a graph-based diffusion method. We prove that label spreading yields consistent probability estimators even when the number of annotations per data point converges to zero.

We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection. We term this technique Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD), which we suggest provides a general framework for distilling predictive uncertainty in complex output spaces beyond language.",

However, effectively coordinating these resources under uncertainties remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel home energy management framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that can jointly minimise energy expenditure and battery degradation while guaranteeing occupant comfort and EV charging requirements. Distinct from existing studies, we explicitly account for the heterogeneous degradation characteristics of stationary and EV batteries in the optimisation, alongside stochastic user behaviour regarding arrival time, departure time, and driving distance. The energy scheduling problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and solved using a Lagrangian soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn optimal control policies that enforce physical constraints, including indoor temperature bounds and target EV state of charge upon departure, despite stochastic uncertainties. Numerical simulations over a one-year horizon demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in satisfying physical constraints while eliminating thermal oscillations and achieving significant economic benefits. Specifically, the method reduces the cumulative operating cost substantially compared to two standard rule-based baselines while simultaneously decreasing battery degradation costs by 8.44%.",

In a within-subject user study ($n = 15$), participants created question-answering datasets using both a baseline tool and AIANO.

T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining.

Quantization is an effective solution, with INT weights and FP activations being widely adopted to preserve accuracy. Prior works further reduce FP overhead by using block floating point (BFP) activations in linear layers, but fail to extend BFP to attention layers due to severe accuracy degradation, limiting overall efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Harmonia, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that enables all-layer BFP activations with a configurable hardware architecture. First, we systematically explore BFP configurations to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and activation compression across all layers. Second, to reduce KV-cache storage and computation in attention layers, we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy and computations in attention layers,we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy combined with a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing technique. This allow aggressive KV-cache compression from FP16 to 4-bit-mantissa BFP with only 0.3% average accuracy loss. Third, to fully exploit all-layer BFP activations, we design dedicated hardware components, including a reconfigurable PE supporting mixed data formats (BFP-INT and BPF-BFP), a real-time FP16-to-BFP converter, and a tiling-aware dataflow to reduce memory traffic. We evaluate Harmonia on GEMM operations in both linear and attention layers across eight widely used LLMs. Compared with prior works, Harmonia achieves 3.84x (up to 5.05x) higher area efficiency, 2.03x (up to 3.90x) better energy efficiency, and 3.08x (up to 4.62x) speedup on average.",

By aligning human and robot hand-eye coordination behaviors in a unified egocentric action space, we train the model progressively in three stages. Extensive experiments on a wheel-based humanoid have demonstrated strong robustness and adaptability of our proposed method across diverse long-horizon tasks spanning multiple active perception scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Automated Essay Scoring systems have traditionally focused on holistic scores, limiting their pedagogical usefulness, especially in the case of complex essay genres such as argumentative writing. In educational contexts, teachers and learners require interpretable, trait-level feedback that aligns with instructional goals and established rubrics. In this paper, we study trait-based Automatic Argumentative Essay Scoring using two complementary modeling paradigms designed for realistic educational deployment: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs, and (2) a supervised, encoder-based BigBird model with a CORAL-style ordinal regression formulation, optimized for long-sequence understanding. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the ASAP++ dataset, which includes essay scores across five quality traits, offering strong coverage of core argumentation dimensions. LLMs are prompted with designed, rubric-aligned in-context examples, along with feedback and confidence requests, while we explicitly model ordinality in scores with the BigBird model via the rank-consistent CORAL framework. Our results show that explicitly modeling score ordinality substantially improves agreement with human raters across all traits, outperforming LLMs and nominal classification and regression-based baselines. This finding reinforces the importance of aligning model objectives with rubric semantics for educational assessment. At the same time, small open-source LLMs achieve a competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning, particularly for reasoning-oriented traits, while enabling transparent, privacy-preserving, and locally deployable assessment scenarios. Our findings provide methodological, modeling, and practical insights for the design of AI-based educational systems that aim to deliver interpretable, rubric-aligned feedback for argumentative writing.",

Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.",

We decompose MT into two subtasks: producing text in the target language (i.e. target language identification) and preserving the input sentence's meaning (i.e. sentence equivalence). Across three families of open-source models and 20 translation directions, we find that distinct, sparse sets of attention heads specialize in each subtask. Based on this insight, we construct subtask-specific steering vectors and show that modifying just 1% of the relevant heads enables instruction-free MT performance comparable to instruction-based prompting, while ablating these heads selectively disrupts their corresponding translation functions.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the progress in the radar sensing technology consisting in the miniaturization of the packages and increase in measuring precision has drawn the interest of the robotics research community. Indeed, a crucial task enabling autonomy in robotics is to precisely determine the pose of the robot in space. To fulfill this task sensor fusion algorithms are often used, in which data from one or several exteroceptive sensors like, for example, LiDAR, camera, laser ranging sensor or GNSS are fused together with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to obtain an estimate of the navigation states of the robot. Nonetheless, owing to their particular sensing principles, some exteroceptive sensors are often incapacitated in extreme environmental conditions, like extreme illumination or presence of fine particles in the environment like smoke or fog. Radars are largely immune to aforementioned factors thanks to the characteristics of electromagnetic waves they use. In this thesis, we present Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms to fuse the information from IMU and radar in order to estimate the navigation states of a (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) UAV capable of running on a portable resource-constrained embedded computer in real-time and making use of inexpensive, consumer-grade sensors. We present novel RIO approaches relying on the multi-state tightly-coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Factor Graphs (FG) fusing instantaneous velocities of and distances to 3D points delivered by a lightweight, low-cost, off-the-shelf Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with IMU readings. We also show a novel way to exploit advances in deep learning to retrieve 3D point correspondences in sparse and noisy radar point clouds.",

However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.",

        "abstract": "Robots are finding wider adoption in human environments, increasing the need for natural human-robot interaction. However, understanding a natural language command requires the robot to infer the intended task and how to decompose it into executable actions, and to ground those actions in the robot's knowledge of the environment, including relevant objects, agents, and locations. This challenge can be addressed by combining the capabilities of Large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language with 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) for grounding inferred actions in a semantic representation of the environment. However, many 3DSGs lack explicit spatial relations between objects, even though humans often rely on these relations to describe an environment. This paper investigates whether incorporating open- or closed-vocabulary spatial relations into 3DSGs can improve the ability of LLMs to interpret natural language commands. To address this, we propose an LLM-based pipeline for target object grounding from open-vocabulary language commands and a vision language model (VLM)-based pipeline to add open-vocabulary spatial edges to 3DSGs from images captured while mapping. Finally, two LLMs are evaluated in a study assessing their performance on the downstream task of target object grounding. Our study demonstrates that explicit spatial relations improve the ability of LLMs to ground objects. Moreover, open-vocabulary relation generation with VLMs proves feasible from robot-captured images, but their advantage over closed-vocabulary relations is found to be limited.",

Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%. Using RM during RLHF, our method effectively improves performance as demonstrated on Arena Hard v2, notably yielding a 7% improvement in creative writing tasks. Further analysis confirms that our method escapes the deceptive alignment trap, effectively reversing the decline in rationale consistency observed in outcome-only training.",

PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.",

However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human judgment in computational social science, yet their ability to reproduce patterns of susceptibility to misinformation remains unclear. We test whether LLM-simulated survey respondents, prompted with participant profiles drawn from social survey data measuring network, demographic, attitudinal and behavioral features, can reproduce human patterns of misinformation belief and sharing. Using three online surveys as baselines, we evaluate whether LLM outputs match observed response distributions and recover feature-outcome associations present in the original survey data. LLM-generated responses capture broad distributional tendencies and show modest correlation with human responses, but consistently overstate the association between belief and sharing. Linear models fit to simulated responses exhibit substantially higher explained variance and place disproportionate weight on attitudinal and behavioral features, while largely ignoring personal network characteristics, relative to models fit to human responses. Analyses of model-generated reasoning and LLM training data suggest that these distortions reflect systematic biases in how misinformation-related concepts are represented. Our findings suggest that LLM-based survey simulations are better suited for diagnosing systematic divergences from human judgment than for substituting it.",

Traditional point prediction methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in time series data, while existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with interpretability. We propose a novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework that addresses these challenges through mixture-of-experts architectures with distributional learning capabilities. Our approach introduces two complementary methods: (1) Multi-Expert LDL, which employs multiple experts with different learned parameters to capture diverse temporal patterns, and (2) Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE, which explicitly decomposes time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, changepoints, volatility) through specialized sub-experts. Both frameworks extend traditional point prediction to distributional learning, enabling rich uncertainty quantification through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We evaluate our methods on aggregated sales data derived from the M5 dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline approaches. The continuous Multi-Expert LDL achieves the best overall performance, while the Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE provides enhanced interpretability through component-wise analysis. Our frameworks successfully balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, making them suitable for real-world forecasting applications where both performance and actionable insights are crucial.",

We introduce two designs, T2A-ControlNet and T2A-Adapter, and show that the T2A-Adapter model offers a more efficient structure with strong control ability. With only 38M additional parameters, T2A-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AudioSet-Strong in both event-level and segment-level F1 scores. We further extend this framework to audio editing, proposing T2A-Editor for removing and inserting audio events at time locations specified by instructions.

To this end, we make the following two contributions. First, we propose ReasoningCodec, a discrete audio codec that factorizes audio into (i) reasoning tokens, which encode text-aligned, high-level analysis and planning representations for audio understanding and hierarchical generation, and (ii) reconstruction tokens, which encode semantic-rich acoustic cues for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. This design achieves understanding performance comparable to strong continuous representations while improving generation quality and reconstruction fidelity over prior discrete tokenizers. Second, we introduce a unified autoregressive architecture for text and audio, together with multi-stage training and multi-task data construction. Using this framework, we train UniAudio 2.0 on 100B text tokens and 60B audio tokens. Across a wide range of speech, sound, and music tasks, UniAudio 2.0 performs competitively on in-domain evaluations and demonstrates strong few-shot and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

Moreover, we evaluate how mitigation strategies influence disability portrayals, with a focus on assessing affective framing through sentiment polarity analysis, combining both automatic and human evaluation.

However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

        "abstract": "Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.",

However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

This makes fine-grained frame modeling essential for accurately detecting subtle spoofing cues. In this work, we propose fine-grained frame modeling (FGFM) for MHSA-based speech deepfake detection, where the most informative frames are first selected through a multi-head voting (MHV) module. These selected frames are then refined via a cross-layer refinement (CLR) module to enhance the model's ability to learn subtle spoofing cues. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline model and achieves Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.90%, 1.88%, and 6.64% on the LA21, DF21, and ITW datasets, respectively.

All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.",

Yet, RAG was recently shown to be quite vulnerable to corpus knowledge poisoning: an attacker injects misleading documents to the corpus to steer an LLMs' output to an undesired response. We argue that the standard causal attention mechanism in LLMs enables harmful cross-document interactions, specifically in cases of attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a novel defense approach for RAG: Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG). This is a block-sparse attention mechanism that disallows cross-attention between retrieved documents. SDAG requires a minimal inference-time change to the attention mask; furthermore, no fine-tuning or additional architectural changes are needed. We present an empirical evaluation of LLM-based question answering (QA) with a variety of attack strategies on RAG. We show that our SDAG method substantially outperforms the standard causal attention mechanism in terms of attack success rate. We further demonstrate the clear merits of integrating SDAG with state-of-the-art RAG defense methods. Specifically, the integration results in performance that is statistically significantly better than the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Aligning text-to-image generation with user intent remains challenging, for users who provide ambiguous inputs and struggle with model idiosyncrasies. We propose Adaptive Prompt Elicitation (APE), a technique that adaptively asks visual queries to help users refine prompts without extensive writing. Our technical contribution is a formulation of interactive intent inference under an information-theoretic framework. APE represents latent intent as interpretable feature requirements using language model priors, adaptively generates visual queries, and compiles elicited requirements into effective prompts. Evaluation on IDEA-Bench and DesignBench shows that APE achieves stronger alignment with improved efficiency. A user study with challenging user-defined tasks demonstrates 19.8% higher alignment without workload overhead. Our work contributes a principled approach to prompting that, for general users, offers an effective and efficient complement to the prevailing prompt-based interaction paradigm with text-to-image models.",

This approach relies on specialized worker agents forming a star topology with the supervisor agent in the middle. We demonstrate its capabilities on a real-world example. Second, we developed an agentic AI solution for the document retrieval task in the context of software engineering documents. Our solution enables performing various use cases on a body of documents related to the development of a single software, including search, question answering, tracking changes, and large document summarization.

Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.\nAcross full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance. To our knowledge, this is the first multilingual, human-annotated benchmark focused explicitly on cultural nuance in translation and localisation, highlighting the need for culturally informed training data, improved cross-lingual pragmatics, and evaluation paradigms that better reflect real-world communicative competence.",

However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation.

We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts. Experiments are in full agreement with these hypotheses. The code is available at https://github.com/EVIEHub/Rationality.",

While many LLMs undergo post-training alignment and safety procedures to avoid expressions of explicit social bias, they still exhibit significant implicit biases on indirect tasks resembling the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Recent work has further shown that inference-time reasoning can impair LLM performance on tasks that rely on implicit statistical learning. Motivated by a theoretical link between implicit associations and statistical learning in human cognition, we examine how reasoning-enabled inference affects implicit bias in LLMs. We find that enabling reasoning significantly reduces measured implicit bias on an IAT-style evaluation for some model classes across fifteen stereotype topics. This effect appears specific to social bias domains, as we observe no corresponding reduction for non-social implicit associations. As reasoning is increasingly enabled by default in deployed LLMs, these findings suggest that it can meaningfully alter fairness evaluation outcomes in some systems, while also raising questions about how alignment procedures interact with inference-time reasoning to drive variation in bias reduction across model types. More broadly, this work highlights how theory from cognitive science and psychology can complement AI evaluation research by providing methodological and interpretive frameworks that reveal new insights into model behavior.",

This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\\%$ and $5.80\\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.",

In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains.",

Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points.

Recent efforts to encode EEG signals into large language models (LLMs) show promise in handling neural signals across diverse patients, but two significant challenges remain: (1) multi-channel heterogeneity, as seizure-relevant information varies substantially across EEG channels, and (2) computing inefficiency, as the EEG signals need to be encoded into a massive number of tokens for the prediction. To address these issues, we draw the EEG signal and propose the novel NeuroCanvas framework. Specifically, NeuroCanvas consists of two modules: (i) The Entropy-guided Channel Selector (ECS) selects the seizure-relevant channels input to LLM and (ii) the following Canvas of Neuron Signal (CNS) converts selected multi-channel heterogeneous EEG signals into structured visual representations. The ECS module alleviates the multi-channel heterogeneity issue, and the CNS uses compact visual tokens to represent the EEG signals that improve the computing efficiency. We evaluate NeuroCanvas across multiple seizure detection datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement of $20\\%$ in F1 score and reductions of $88\\%$ in inference latency. These results highlight NeuroCanvas as a scalable and effective solution for real-time and resource-efficient seizure detection in clinical http://practice.The code will be released at https://github.com/Yanchen30247/seizure_detect.",

In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space.

Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.",

While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \\textsc{Light Forcing}, the \\textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \\textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \\textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\\eg, $1.2{\\sim}1.3\\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \\textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\\times$ speedup and 19.7\\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU.

While control theory gives safety guarantees for standard controller designs, the practical implementation of controllers in software introduces complexities that are often overlooked. Controllers are often designed in continuous space, while the software is executed in discrete space, undermining some of the theoretical guarantees. Despite extensive research on control theory and control modeling, little attention has been paid to the implementations of controllers and how their theoretical guarantees are ensured in real-world software systems. We investigate 184 real-world controller implementations in open-source robot software. We examine their application context, the implementation characteristics, and the testing methods employed to ensure correctness. We find that the implementations often handle discretization in an ad hoc manner, leading to potential issues with real-time reliability. Challenges such as timing inconsistencies, lack of proper error handling, and inadequate consideration of real-time constraints further complicate matters. Testing practices are superficial, no systematic verification of theoretical guarantees is used, leaving possible inconsistencies between expected and actual behavior. Our findings highlight the need for improved implementation guidelines and rigorous verification techniques to ensure the reliability and safety of robotic controllers in practice.",

We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains.

Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.",

Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation.",

This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions). Ablation studies validate CAT signals, evolution, and predictive discrepancy as essential. We release code and data for reproducibility.",

These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.",

We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring \"Closed-Book Training\" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL.

In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.",

While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.",

We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning. Our results show that disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty baselines as an error detector, improving both F1 and AUROC across settings.

Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.",

This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.\nWe introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.",

To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.",

In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods. This highlights the suitability as a scalable and reproducible benchmark for CRL research.",

Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.",

Leveraging simulation environments with access to ground-truth state, we show that this probing accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance across diverse environments and learning settings, significantly outperforming prior metrics and enabling efficient representation selection.

We validate p-dit dynamics by reproducing known critical behavior of the 2D Potts model. Second, we propose mean-field constraints (MFC), a hybrid scheme that replaces dense pairwise constraint couplings with dynamically updated single-node biases. Applied to balanced graph partitioning, MFC achieves solution quality comparable to exact all-to-all constraint formulations while dramatically reducing graph density.

To enhance generalization further, we propose dynamic stochastic perturbation, a novel regularization technique that introduces controlled variability into the embeddings during generation, promoting robustness to unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that URSA-GAN effectively reduces character error rates in ASR and improves perceptual metrics in SE across diverse noisy and mismatched channel scenarios. Notably, evaluations on compound test conditions with both channel and noise degradations confirm the generalization ability of URSA-GAN, yielding relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics.",

        "abstract": "Constructing mechanistic models of neural circuits is a fundamental goal of neuroscience, yet verifying such models is limited by the lack of ground truth. To rigorously test model discovery, we establish an in silico testbed using neuromechanical simulations of a larval zebrafish as a transparent ground truth. We find that LLM-based tree search autonomously discovers predictive models that significantly outperform established forecasting baselines. Conditioning on sensory drive is necessary but not sufficient for faithful system identification, as models exploit statistical shortcuts. Structural priors prove essential for enabling robust out-of-distribution generalization and recovery of interpretable mechanistic models. Our insights provide guidance for modeling real-world neural recordings and offer a broader template for AI-driven scientific discovery.",

        "abstract": "We propose a cross-attention Transformer for joint decoding of uplink OFDM signals received by multiple coordinated access points. A shared per-receiver encoder learns time-frequency structure within each received grid, and a token-wise cross-attention module fuses the receivers to produce soft log-likelihood ratios for a standard channel decoder, without requiring explicit per-receiver channel estimates. Trained with a bit-metric objective, the model adapts its fusion to per-receiver reliability, tolerates missing or degraded links, and remains robust when pilots are sparse. Across realistic Wi-Fi channels, it consistently outperforms classical pipelines and strong convolutional baselines, frequently matching (and in some cases surpassing) a powerful baseline that assumes perfect channel knowledge per access point. Despite its expressiveness, the architecture is compact, has low computational cost (low GFLOPs), and achieves low latency on GPUs, making it a practical building block for next-generation Wi-Fi receivers.",

        "abstract": "Spoken dialogues with and between voice agents are becoming increasingly common, yet assessing them for their socially harmful content such as violence, harassment, and hate remains text-centric and fails to account for audio-specific cues and transcription errors. We present LALM-as-a-Judge, the first controlled benchmark and systematic study of large audio-language models (LALMs) as safety judges for multi-turn spoken dialogues. We generate 24,000 unsafe and synthetic spoken dialogues in English that consist of 3-10 turns, by having a single dialogue turn including content with one of 8 harmful categories (e.g., violence) and on one of 5 grades, from very mild to severe. On 160 dialogues, 5 human raters confirmed reliable unsafe detection and a meaningful severity scale. We benchmark three open-source LALMs: Qwen2-Audio, Audio Flamingo 3, and MERaLiON as zero-shot judges that output a scalar safety score in [0,1] across audio-only, transcription-only, or multimodal inputs, along with a transcription-only LLaMA baseline. We measure the judges' sensitivity to detecting unsafe content, the specificity in ordering severity levels, and the stability of the score in dialogue turns. Results reveal architecture- and modality-dependent trade-offs: the most sensitive judge is also the least stable across turns, while stable configurations sacrifice detection of mild harmful content. Transcription quality is a key bottleneck: Whisper-Large may significantly reduce sensitivity for transcription-only modes, while largely preserving severity ordering. Audio becomes crucial when paralinguistic cues or transcription fidelity are category-critical. We summarize all findings and provide actionable guidance for practitioners.",

        "abstract": "Recent progress has rapidly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying in-context learning in modern attention-based neural networks. However, existing results focus exclusively on unimodal data; in contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of in-context learning for multi-modal data remain poorly understood. We introduce a mathematically tractable framework for studying multi-modal learning and explore when transformer-like architectures can recover Bayes-optimal performance in-context. To model multi-modal problems, we assume the observed data arises from a latent factor model. Our first result comprises a negative take on expressibility: we prove that single-layer, linear self-attention fails to recover the Bayes-optimal predictor uniformly over the task distribution. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, linearized cross-attention mechanism, which we study in the regime where both the number of cross-attention layers and the context length are large. We show that this cross-attention mechanism is provably Bayes optimal when optimized using gradient flow. Our results underscore the benefits of depth for in-context learning and establish the provable utility of cross-attention for multi-modal distributions.",
