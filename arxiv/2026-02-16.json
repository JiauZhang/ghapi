        "abstract": "Timely classification of humanitarian information from social media is critical for effective disaster response. However, deploying large language models (LLMs) for this task faces challenges in resource-constrained emergency settings. This paper develops a lightweight, cost-effective framework for disaster tweet classification using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We construct a unified experimental corpus by integrating and normalizing the HumAID dataset (76,484 tweets across 19 disaster events) into a dual-task benchmark: humanitarian information categorization and event type identification. Through systematic evaluation of prompting strategies, LoRA fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on Llama 3.1 8B, we demonstrate that: (1) LoRA achieves 79.62% humanitarian classification accuracy (+37.79% over zero-shot) while training only ~2% of parameters; (2) QLoRA enables efficient deployment with 99.4% of LoRA performance at 50% memory cost; (3) contrary to common assumptions, RAG strategies degrade fine-tuned model performance due to label noise from retrieved examples. These findings establish a practical, reproducible pipeline for building reliable crisis intelligence systems with limited computational resources.",

While persona-induced biases in text generation are well documented, their effects on agent task performance remain largely unexplored, even though such effects pose more direct operational risks. In this work, we present the first systematic case study showing that demographic-based persona assignments can alter LLM agents' behavior and degrade performance across diverse domains. Evaluating widely deployed models on agentic benchmarks spanning strategic reasoning, planning, and technical operations, we uncover substantial performance variations - up to 26.2% degradation, driven by task-irrelevant persona cues. These shifts appear across task types and model architectures, indicating that persona conditioning and simple prompt injections can distort an agent's decision-making reliability. Our findings reveal an overlooked vulnerability in current LLM agentic systems: persona assignments can introduce implicit biases and increase behavioral volatility, raising concerns for the safe and robust deployment of LLM agents.",

A new family of named entity correction methods based on large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged. However, these approaches have yet to fully exploit the sophisticated reasoning capabilities inherent to LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework for correcting named entity errors in ASR. Our approach consists of two key components: (1) a rephrasing language model (RLM) for named entity recognition, followed by candidate retrieval using a phonetic-level edit distance; and (2) a novel self-taught reasoning model with adaptive chain-of-thought (A-STAR) that dynamically adjusts the depth of its reasoning based on task difficulty. Experiments on the AISHELL-1 and Homophone datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves relative reductions in the named entity character error rate of 17.96\\% and 34.42\\%, respectively, compared to a strong baseline.",

        "abstract": "With the growth of intelligent civil infrastructure and smart cities, operation and maintenance (O&M) increasingly requires safe, efficient, and energy-conscious robotic manipulation of articulated components, including access doors, service drawers, and pipeline valves. However, existing robotic approaches either focus primarily on grasping or target object-specific articulated manipulation, and they rarely incorporate explicit actuation energy into multi-objective optimisation, which limits their scalability and suitability for long-term deployment in real O&M settings. Therefore, this paper proposes an articulation-agnostic and energy-aware reinforcement learning framework for robotic manipulation in intelligent infrastructure O&M. The method combines part-guided 3D perception, weighted point sampling, and PointNet-based encoding to obtain a compact geometric representation that generalises across heterogeneous articulated objects. Manipulation is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), in which actuation energy is explicitly modelled and regulated via a Lagrangian-based constrained Soft Actor-Critic scheme. The policy is trained end-to-end under this CMDP formulation, enabling effective articulated-object operation while satisfying a long-horizon energy budget. Experiments on representative O&M tasks demonstrate 16%-30% reductions in energy consumption, 16%-32% fewer steps to success, and consistently high success rates, indicating a scalable and sustainable solution for infrastructure O&M manipulation.",

Benefiting from the rapid advancement of joint audio-video generation, this paper proposes a more compelling new task: sync audio-video customization, which aims to synchronously customize both video identity and audio timbre. Specifically, given a reference image $I^{r}$ and a reference audio $A^{r}$, this novel task requires generating videos that maintain the identity of the reference image while imitating the timbre of the reference audio, with spoken content freely specifiable through user-provided textual prompts. To this end, we propose OmniCustom, a powerful DiT-based audio-video customization framework that can synthesize a video following reference image identity, audio timbre, and text prompts all at once in a zero-shot manner. Our framework is built on three key contributions. First, identity and audio timbre control are achieved through separate reference identity and audio LoRA modules that operate through self-attention layers within the base audio-video generation model. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning objective alongside the standard flow matching objective. It uses predicted flows conditioned on reference inputs as positive examples and those without reference conditions as negative examples, thereby enhancing the model ability to preserve identity and timbre. Third, we train OmniCustom on our constructed large-scale, high-quality audio-visual human dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniCustom outperforms existing methods in generating audio-video content with consistent identity and timbre fidelity.",

Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence.",

The system employs four specialized agents: a natural language interpreter that converts user requests into physics-based descriptions; a technical requirements generator that produces scaled simulation parameters; a physics code generator with automated self-correction; and a physics validator that implements perceptual self-reflection. The key innovation is perceptual validation, which analyzes rendered animation frames using a vision-capable language model rather than inspecting code structure directly. This approach addresses the ``oracle gap'' where syntactically correct code produces physically incorrect behavior--a limitation that conventional testing cannot detect. We evaluate the system across seven domains including classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, wave physics, reaction-diffusion systems, and non-physics data visualization. The perceptual self-reflection architecture demonstrates substantial improvement over single-shot generation baselines, with the majority of tested scenarios achieving target physics accuracy thresholds. The system exhibits robust pipeline stability with consistent code self-correction capability, operating at approximately \\$0.20 per animation. These results validate our hypothesis that feeding visual simulation outputs back to a vision-language model for iterative refinement significantly outperforms single-shot code generation for physics simulation tasks and highlights the potential of agentic AI to support engineering workflows and physics data generation pipelines.",

Instead of distilling high-dimensional Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings using model-specific decoders, LatentAM proposes an online dictionary learning approach that is both model-agnostic and pretraining-free, enabling plug-and-play integration with different VLMs at test time. Specifically, our approach associates each Gaussian primitive with a compact query vector that can be converted into approximate VLM embeddings using an attention mechanism with a learnable dictionary. The dictionary is initialized efficiently from streaming observations and optimized online to adapt to evolving scene semantics under trust-region regularization. To scale to long trajectories and large environments, we further propose an efficient map management strategy based on voxel hashing, where optimization is restricted to an active local map on the GPU, while the global map is stored and indexed on the CPU to maintain bounded GPU memory usage. Experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale custom dataset demonstrate that LatentAM attains significantly better feature reconstruction fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods, while achieving near-real-time speed (12-35 FPS) on the evaluated datasets.

These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found \"in the wild\" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool. We release the model checkpoints and code online.",

To establish a shared semantic latent space, the transmitters/receivers in TokenCom need to agree on an identical tokenizer model and codebook. To this end, an initial Tokenizer Agreement (TA) process is carried out in each communication episode, where the transmitter/receiver cooperate to choose from a set of pre-trained tokenizer models/ codebooks available to them both for efficient TokenCom. In this correspondence, we investigate TA in a multi-user downlink wireless TokenCom scenario, where the base station equipped with multiple antennas transmits video token streams to multiple users. We formulate the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, and propose a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates a deep Q-network (DQN) for joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in terms of semantic quality and resource efficiency, while reducing the freezing events in video transmission by 68% compared to the conventional H.265-based scheme.",

Unlike existing single-turn paradigm, LongNav-R1 reformulates the navigation decision process as a continuous multi-turn conversation between the VLA policy and the embodied environment. This multi-turn RL framework offers two distinct advantages: i) it enables the agent to reason about the causal effects of historical interactions and sequential future outcomes; and ii) it allows the model to learn directly from online interactions, fostering diverse trajectory generation and avoiding the behavioral rigidity often imposed by human demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Horizon-Adaptive Policy Optimization. This mechanism explicitly accounts for varying horizon lengths during advantage estimation, facilitating accurate temporal credit assignment over extended sequences. Consequently, the agent develops diverse navigation behaviors and resists collapse during long-horizon tasks. Experiments on object navigation benchmarks validate the framework's efficacy: With 4,000 rollout trajectories, LongNav-R1 boosts the Qwen3-VL-2B success rate from 64.3% to 73.0%. These results demonstrate superior sample efficiency and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. The model's generalizability and robustness are further validated by its zero-shot performance in long-horizon real-world navigation settings. All source code will be open-sourced upon publication.",

        "abstract": "Benchmarking has long served as a foundational practice in machine learning and, increasingly, in modern AI systems such as large language models, where shared tasks, metrics, and leaderboards offer a common basis for measuring progress and comparing approaches. As AI systems are deployed in more varied and consequential settings, though, there is growing value in complementing these established practices with a more holistic conceptualization of what evaluation should represent. Of note, recognizing the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems operate invites an opportunity for a deeper view of how multiple stakeholders and their unique priorities might inform what we consider meaningful or desirable model behavior. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes benchmarking as a multilayer, adaptive network linking evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups through weighted interactions. Using conjoint-derived utilities and a human-in-the-loop update rule, we formalize how human tradeoffs can be embedded into benchmark structure and how benchmarks can evolve dynamically while preserving stability and interpretability. The resulting formulation generalizes classical leaderboards as a special case and provides a foundation for building evaluation protocols that are more context aware, resulting in new robust tools for analyzing the structural properties of benchmarks, which opens a path toward more accountable and human-aligned evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Recent progress in large models has led to significant advances in unified multimodal generation and understanding. However, the development of models that unify motion-language generation and understanding remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches often fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on paired motion-text data, which can result in catastrophic forgetting of linguistic capabilities due to the limited scale of available text-motion pairs. Furthermore, prior methods typically convert motion into discrete representations via quantization to integrate with language models, introducing substantial jitter artifacts from discrete tokenization. To address these challenges, we propose LLaMo, a unified framework that extends pretrained LLMs through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. This design inherently preserves the language understanding of the base model while enabling scalable multimodal adaptation. We encode human motion into a causal continuous latent space and maintain the next-token prediction paradigm in the decoder-only backbone through a lightweight flow-matching head, allowing for streaming motion generation in real-time (>30 FPS). Leveraging the comprehensive language understanding of pretrained LLMs and large-scale motion-text pretraining, our experiments demonstrate that LLaMo achieves high-fidelity text-to-motion generation and motion-to-text captioning in general settings, especially zero-shot motion generation, marking a significant step towards a general unified motion-language large model.",

We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid http://outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.",

The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari.",

While Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE) G-computation offers a principled approach, its recursive structure suffers from error propagation, corrupting the learned outcome regression models. We propose D3-Net, a framework that mitigates error propagation in ICE training and then applies a robust final correction. First, to interrupt error propagation during learning, we train the ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust (SDR) pseudo-outcomes, which provide bias-corrected targets for each regression. Second, we employ a multi-task Transformer with a covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision, regularizing representations against corruption by noisy pseudo-outcomes, and a target network to stabilize training dynamics. For the final estimate, we discard the SDR correction and instead use the uncorrected nuisance models to perform Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (LTMLE) on the original outcomes. This second-stage, targeted debiasing ensures robustness and optimal finite-sample properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model, D3-Net, robustly reduces bias and variance across different horizons, counterfactuals, and time-varying confoundings, compared to existing state-of-the-art ICE-based estimators.",

        "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of Bitcoin (BTC) has always been a challenge because decentralized markets are non-linear, highly volatile, and have temporal irregularities. Existing deep learning models often struggle with interpretability and generalization across diverse market conditions. This research presents a hybrid stacked-generalization framework, TFT-ACB-XML, for BTC closing price prediction. The framework integrates two parallel base learners: a customized Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and an Attention-Customized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (ACB), followed by an XGBoost regressor as the meta-learner. The customized TFT model handles long-range dependencies and global temporal dynamics via variable selection networks and interpretable single-head attention. The ACB module uses a new attention mechanism alongside the customized BiLSTM to capture short-term sequential dependencies. Predictions from both customized TFT and ACB are weighted through an error-reciprocal weighting strategy. These weights are derived from validation performance, where a model showing lower prediction error receives a higher weight. Finally, the framework concatenates these weighted outputs into a feature vector and feeds the vector to an XGBoost regressor, which captures non-linear residuals and produces the final BTC closing price prediction. Empirical validation using BTC data from October 1, 2014, to January 5, 2026, shows improved performance of the proposed framework compared to recent Deep Learning and Transformer baseline models. The results show a MAPE of 0.65%, an MAE of 198.15, and an RMSE of 258.30 for one-step-ahead out-of-sample under a walk-forward evaluation on the test block. The evaluation period spans the 2024 BTC halving and the spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds) period, which coincide with major liquidity and volatility shifts.",

Synthetic image detection (SID) has thus become an important area of research. Prior work has highlighted how synthetic images differ from real photographs--unfortunately, SID methods often struggle to generalize to novel generative models and often perform poorly in practical settings. CLIP, a foundational vision-language model which yields semantically rich image-text embeddings, shows strong accuracy and generalization for SID. Yet, the underlying relevant cues embedded in CLIP-features remain unknown. It is unclear, whether CLIP-based detectors simply detect strong visual artifacts or exploit subtle semantic biases, both of which would render them useless in practical settings or on generative models of high quality. We introduce SynthCLIC, a paired dataset of real photographs and high-quality synthetic counterparts from recent diffusion models, designed to reduce semantic bias in SID. Using an interpretable linear head with de-correlated activations and a text-grounded concept-model, we analyze what CLIP-based detectors learn. CLIP-based linear detectors reach 0.96 mAP on a GAN-based benchmark but only 0.92 on our high-quality diffusion dataset SynthCLIC, and generalization across generator families drops to as low as 0.37 mAP. We find that the detectors primarily rely on high-level photographic attributes (e.g., minimalist style, lens flare, or depth layering), rather than overt generator-specific artifacts. CLIP-based detectors perform well overall but generalize unevenly across diverse generative architectures. This highlights the need for continual model updates and broader training exposure, while reinforcing CLIP-based approaches as a strong foundation for more universal, robust SID.",

Although these platforms are engineered to withstand such conditions, mechanical degradation is inevitable. Structural damage manifests as consistent and notable changes in kinodynamic behavior compared to a healthy vehicle. Given the heterogeneous nature of structural failures, quantifying various damages to inform kinodynamics is challenging. We posit that natural language can describe and thus capture this variety of damages. Therefore, we propose Zero-shot Language Informed Kinodynamics (ZLIK), which employs self-supervised learning to ground semantic information of damage descriptions in kinodynamic behaviors to learn a forward kinodynamics model in a data-driven manner. Using the high-fidelity soft-body physics simulator http://BeamNG.tech, we collect data from a variety of structurally compromised vehicles. Our learned model achieves zero-shot adaptation to different damages with up to 81% reduction in kinodynamics error and generalizes across the sim-to-real and full-to-1/10$^{\\text{th}}$ scale gaps.",

To bridge this gap, we study Risk-averse Quantal response Equilibria (RQE), a solution concept rooted in behavioral game theory that incorporates risk aversion and bounded rationality. We demonstrate that RQE possesses strong regularity conditions that make it uniquely amenable to learning in MGs. We propose a novel two-timescale Actor-Critic algorithm characterized by a fast-timescale actor and a slow-timescale critic. Leveraging the regularity of RQE, we prove that this approach achieves global convergence with finite-sample guarantees.

This work presents a reproducibility study of DragDiffusion using the authors' released implementation and the DragBench benchmark. We reproduce the main ablation studies on diffusion timestep selection, LoRA-based fine-tuning, mask regularization strength, and UNet feature supervision, and observe close agreement with the qualitative and quantitative trends reported in the original work. At the same time, our experiments show that performance is sensitive to a small number of hyperparameter assumptions, particularly the optimized timestep and the feature level used for motion supervision, while other components admit broader operating ranges. We further evaluate a multi-timestep latent optimization variant and find that it does not improve spatial accuracy while substantially increasing computational cost. Overall, our findings support the central claims of DragDiffusion while clarifying the conditions under which they are reliably reproducible.

This gap is primarily due to (i) the absence of high-quality, privacy-sensitive data that capture personalized user-LLM interactions at scale, and (ii) the lack of robust reward signals for individual preferences. To overcome existing data limitations, we introduce a high-fidelity synthetic data generation framework called PersonaGym. Unlike prior work that treats personalization as static persona-preference pairs, PersonaGym models a dynamic preference process via an agentic LLM system to simulate realistic preference behaviors and semantic-aware noise in order to generate personalized multi-turn interaction trajectories. Using PersonaGym, we release PersonaAtlas, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse synthetic dataset of high-fidelity multi-turn personalized interaction trajectories that closely mirror real-world preference expression and noise patterns. We further propose Personalized Prompt Optimization (PPOpt), a scalable and model-agnostic framework that optimizes user prompts based on interaction histories without modifying the deployed LLM. PPOpt adopts a reason-then-optimize paradigm that infers an explicit user profile and conditions prompt rewriting on the user profile to avoid reward hacking. Our training procedure for PPOpt integrates a cold-start supervised prior with outcome-driven multi-objective reinforcement learning.

To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RL's reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not a uniform enhancement of visual perception, but a systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements.",

Furthermore, we point out a more critical bottleneck: existing unadaptive fully noised generators produce features disconnected from real test samples, which also leads to the spurious correlation. To enhance the visual-semantic correlations on both seen and unseen classes, we propose ZeroDiff++, a diffusion-based generative framework. In training, ZeroDiff++ uses (i) diffusion augmentation to produce diverse noised samples, (ii) supervised contrastive (SC) representations for instance level semantics, and (iii) multi view discriminators with Wasserstein mutual learning to assess generated features.

However, despite the continued rise in design complexity, advances in AMS automation remain limited. This reflects the central challenge in developing a generalized optimization method applicable across diverse circuit design spaces, many of which are distinct, constrained, and non-differentiable. To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation. Importantly, the proposed approach operates at the level of individual transistors, enabling highly expressive, fine-grained topology generation. Strong inductive biases encoded in the action space and environment further drive structurally consistent and valid generation. Experimental results for three realistic design tasks illustrate substantial improvements in conventional design metrics over state-of-the-art baselines, with 100% of generated designs being structurally correct and over 90% demonstrating required functionality.",

We study a recent MonoScore metric and derive a single-pass algorithm that computes exactly the same quantity, but with a cost that grows linearly, rather than quadratically, with the number of dataset images. On OpenImagesV7, we achieve up to a 1200x speedup wall-clock speedup in evaluation and 159x during training, while adding only ~4% per-epoch overhead. This allows us to treat MonoScore as a training signal: we introduce the Monosemanticity Loss (MonoLoss), a plug-in objective that directly rewards semantically consistent activations for learning interpretable monosemantic representations. Across SAEs trained on CLIP, SigLIP2, and pretrained ViT features, using BatchTopK, TopK, and JumpReLU SAEs, MonoLoss increases MonoScore for most latents. MonoLoss also consistently improves class purity (the fraction of a latent's activating images belonging to its dominant class) across all encoder and SAE combinations, with the largest gain raising baseline purity from 0.152 to 0.723. Used as an auxiliary regularizer during ResNet-50 and CLIP-ViT-B/32 finetuning, MonoLoss yields up to 0.6\\% accuracy gains on ImageNet-1K and monosemantic activating patterns on standard benchmark datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/MonoLoss.",

        "abstract": "Reasoning about failures is crucial for building reliable and trustworthy robotic systems. Prior approaches either treat failure reasoning as a closed-set classification problem or assume access to ample human annotations. Failures in the real world are typically subtle, combinatorial, and difficult to enumerate, whereas rich reasoning labels are expensive to acquire. We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark. We argue that recent benchmark gains are thus confounded: the prevalence of soft contamination means gains reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data and effective test data in growing training corpora.",

These environments are dynamic and often visually occluded, which complicates perception and navigation. In this context, valuable information from audio sources remains underutilized in most autonomy stacks. This work presents a control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter that provides safety guarantees for obstacle avoidance while adapting safety margins during navigation using an audio-derived risk cue. The proposed framework augments the CBF with a lightweight, real-time jackhammer detector based on signal envelope and periodicity. Its output serves as an exogenous risk that is directly enforced in the controller by modulating the barrier function. The approach is evaluated in simulation with two CBF formulations (circular and goal-aligned elliptical) with a unicycle robot navigating a cluttered construction environment. Results show that the CBF safety filter eliminates safety violations across all trials while reaching the target in 40.2% (circular) vs. 76.5% (elliptical), as the elliptical formulation better avoids deadlock. This integration of audio perception into a CBF-based controller demonstrates a pathway toward richer multimodal safety reasoning in autonomous robots for safety-critical and dynamic environments.",

Across four aligned instruction-tuned models and twelve jailbreak attacks, CC-Delta achieves comparable or better safety-utility tradeoffs than baseline defenses operating in dense latent space. In particular, our method clearly outperforms dense mean-shift steering on all four models, and particularly against out-of-distribution attacks, showing that steering in sparse SAE feature space offers advantages over steering in dense activation space for jailbreak mitigation.

Cache data analysis requires parsing millions of trace entries with manual filtering, making the process slow and non-interactive. To address this, we introduce CacheMind, a conversational tool that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable semantic reasoning over cache traces. Architects can now ask natural language questions like, \"Why is the memory access associated with PC X causing more evictions?\", and receive trace-grounded, human-readable answers linked to program semantics for the first time. To evaluate CacheMind, we present CacheMindBench, the first verified benchmark suite for LLM-based reasoning for the cache replacement problem. Using the SIEVE retriever, CacheMind achieves 66.67% on 75 unseen trace-grounded questions and 84.80% on 25 unseen policy-specific reasoning tasks; with RANGER, it achieves 89.33% and 64.80% on the same evaluations. Additionally, with RANGER, CacheMind achieves 100% accuracy on 4 out of 6 categories in the trace-grounded tier of CacheMindBench. Compared to LlamaIndex (10% retrieval success), SIEVE achieves 60% and RANGER achieves 90%, demonstrating that existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) are insufficient for precise, trace-grounded microarchitectural reasoning. We provided four concrete actionable insights derived using CacheMind, wherein bypassing use case improved cache hit rate by 7.66% and speedup by 2.04%, software fix use case gives speedup of 76%, and Mockingjay replacement policy use case gives speedup of 0.7%; showing the utility of CacheMind on non-trivial queries that require a natural-language interface.",

To address this limitation, we propose RankLLM, a novel framework designed to quantify both question difficulty and model competency. RankLLM introduces difficulty as the primary criterion for differentiation, enabling a more fine-grained evaluation of LLM capabilities. RankLLM's core mechanism facilitates bidirectional score propagation between models and questions. The core intuition of RankLLM is that a model earns a competency score when it correctly answers a question, while a question's difficulty score increases when it challenges a model. Using this framework, we evaluate 30 models on 35,550 questions across multiple domains. RankLLM achieves 90% agreement with human judgments and consistently outperforms strong baselines such as IRT. It also exhibits strong stability, fast convergence, and high computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for large-scale, difficulty-aware LLM evaluation.",

Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary \"full-rank\" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors. Our method enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead. Finally, we establish compute-optimal scaling laws for natively low-rank transformers, demonstrating predictable power-law behavior and improved inference efficiency relative to dense models.",

Rather than encoding all procedural knowledge within model weights, agent skills -- composable packages of instructions, code, and resources that agents load on demand -- enable dynamic capability extension without retraining. It is formalized in a paradigm of progressive disclosure, portable skill definitions, and integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This survey provides a comprehensive treatment of the agent skills landscape, as it has rapidly evolved during the last few months. We organize the field along four axes: (i) architectural foundations, examining the http://SKILL.md specification, progressive context loading, and the complementary roles of skills and MCP; (ii) skill acquisition, covering reinforcement learning with skill libraries (SAGE), autonomous skill discovery (SEAgent), and compositional skill synthesis; (iii) deployment at scale, including the computer-use agent (CUA) stack, GUI grounding advances, and benchmark progress on OSWorld and SWE-bench; and (iv) security, where recent empirical analyses reveal that 26.1\\% of community-contributed skills contain vulnerabilities, motivating our proposed Skill Trust and Lifecycle Governance Framework -- a four-tier, gate-based permission model that maps skill provenance to graduated deployment capabilities. We identify seven open challenges -- from cross-platform skill portability to capability-based permission models -- and propose a research agenda for realizing trustworthy, self-improving skill ecosystems.

Prior work in zero-shot coordination often follows a two-stage process, first generating a diverse training pool of partner agents, and then training a best-response agent to collaborate effectively with the entire training pool. While many previous works have achieved strong performance by devising better ways to diversify the partner agent pool, there has been less emphasis on how to leverage this pool to build an adaptive agent. One limitation is that the best-response agent may converge to a static, generalist policy that performs reasonably well across diverse teammates, rather than learning a more adaptive, specialist policy that can better adapt to teammates and achieve higher synergy. To address this, we propose an adaptive ensemble agent that uses Theory-of-Mind-based best-response selection to first infer its teammate's intentions and then select the most suitable policy from a policy ensemble. We conduct experiments in the Overcooked environment to evaluate zero-shot coordination performance under both fully and partially observable settings.

However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets.

We introduce a training-free guidance method for steering continuous diffusion language models to satisfy formal syntactic constraints expressed using regular expressions. Our approach constructs an analytic score estimating the probability that a latent state decodes to a valid string accepted by a given regular expression, and uses its gradient to guide sampling, without training auxiliary classifiers. The denoising process targets the base model conditioned on syntactic validity.\nWe implement our method in Diffinity on top of the PLAID diffusion model and evaluate it on 180 regular-expression constraints over JSON and natural-language benchmarks. Diffinity achieves 68-96\\% constraint satisfaction while incurring only a small perplexity cost relative to unconstrained sampling, outperforming autoregressive constrained decoding in both constraint satisfaction and output quality.",

Traditional approaches treat it as an optimization problem, relying on per-instance heuristics or constraint-based search. We instead reframe RNA design as conditional sequence generation and introduce a reusable neural approximator, instantiated as an autoregressive language model (LM), that maps target structures directly to sequences. We first train our model in a supervised setting on random-induced structure-sequence pairs, and then use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize end-to-end metrics. We also propose methods to select a small subset for RL that greatly improves RL efficiency and quality. Across four datasets, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems on key metrics such as Boltzmann probability while being 1.7x faster, establishing conditional LM generation as a scalable, task-agnostic alternative to per-instance optimization for RNA design.

To address this, we present MXFormer, a novel, hybrid, weight-stationary Compute-in-Memory (CIM) accelerator that provides high throughput and efficiency for fixed-model inference on large short-sequence Transformers. Our architecture's foundation is the use of ultra-dense Charge-Trap Transistors (CTTs) in Microscaling MXFP4 CIM arrays, uniquely enabling the on-chip storage of up to hundreds of millions of parameters in Fully Weight Stationary (FWS) fashion.\nWe introduce a statically partitioned design with 12 Transformer blocks connected by a deeply pipelined dataflow. Static-weight layers (MLPs and linear projections) execute on highly parallel analog CTT arrays using an MXFP4-native flow with per-block exponent alignment and a 10-bit SAR ADC. Dynamic computations are handled in fully accurate digital blocks that utilize MXFP-enabled systolic arrays for scaled dot-product attention and vector units for LayerNorm and FlashAttention-style Softmax.\nBy eliminating all weight movement, the deeply pipelined MXFormer architecture yields very high single-stream throughput and efficiency, processing 58275 FPS on ViT-L/32 (dual-chip) or 41269 FPS on ViT-B/16 (single chip). MXFormer outperforms comparable state-of-the-art non-FWS digital, hybrid and photonic Transformer accelerators ~3.3x-60.5x in compute density and ~1.7x-2.5x in energy efficiency. Against FWS accelerators, MXFormer improves compute density by ~20.9x and resident weight storage density by ~2x, while preserving near-digital accuracy (drop of <1%) without any model retraining.",

Assuming unknown nonlinear dynamics that evolve in continuous time and are input-affine, we derive a continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the value function and show that the corresponding advantage function is quadratic in the action and optimal policy. Based on this structure, we introduce a model-free actor-critic algorithm that learns policies and value functions for static or moving obstacles using gradient descent. We then compose multiple reach/avoid models via a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), yielding formal obstacle-avoidance guarantees in terms of value-function level sets, providing a model-free alternative to CLF/CBF-based controllers.

We present a first-step analysis of generalization and learning dynamics for a simplified but representative Mamba block: a single-layer, single-head selective SSM with input-dependent gating, followed by a two-layer MLP trained via gradient descent (GD). Our study adopts a structured data model with tokens that include both class-relevant and class-irrelevant patterns under token-level noise and examines two canonical regimes: majority-voting and locality-structured data sequences. We prove that the model achieves guaranteed generalization by establishing non-asymptotic sample complexity and convergence rate bounds, which improve as the effective signal increases and the noise decreases. Furthermore, we show that the gating vector aligns with class-relevant features while ignoring irrelevant ones, thereby formalizing a feature-selection role similar to attention but realized through selective recurrence. Numerical experiments on synthetic data justify our theoretical results. Overall, our results provide principled insight into when and why Mamba-style selective SSMs learn efficiently, offering a theoretical counterpoint to Transformer-centric explanations.",

Existing automated approaches, including traditional machine learning techniques and recent large language model (LLM)-based methods, often suffer from poor precision-recall trade-offs. Frequently evaluated on randomly sampled commits, we uncover that they are substantially underestimating real-world difficulty, where candidate commits are already security-relevant and highly similar. We propose Favia, a forensic, agent-based framework for vulnerability-fix identification that combines scalable candidate ranking with deep and iterative semantic reasoning. Favia first employs an efficient ranking stage to narrow the search space of commits. Each commit is then rigorously evaluated using a ReAct-based LLM agent. By providing the agent with a pre-commit repository as environment, along with specialized tools, the agent tries to localize vulnerable components, navigates the codebase, and establishes causal alignment between code changes and vulnerability root causes. This evidence-driven process enables robust identification of indirect, multi-file, and non-trivial fixes that elude single-pass or similarity-based methods. We evaluate Favia on CVEVC, a large-scale dataset we made that comprises over 8 million commits from 3,708 real-world repositories, and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and LLM-based baselines under realistic candidate selection, achieving the strongest precision-recall trade-offs and highest F1-scores.",

While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning.",

To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite for MFGs (Bench-MFG), focusing on the discrete-time, discrete-space, stationary setting for the sake of clarity. We introduce a taxonomy of problem classes, ranging from no-interaction and monotone games to potential and dynamics-coupled games, and provide prototypical environments for each. Furthermore, we propose MF-Garnets, a method for generating random MFG instances to facilitate rigorous statistical testing. We benchmark a variety of learning algorithms across these environments, including a novel black-box approach (MF-PSO) for exploitability minimization. Based on our extensive empirical results, we propose guidelines to standardize future experimental comparisons.

SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions.

While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining.",

While this paradigm better exploits the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, most existing LLM-based rerankers rely on autoregressive generation, which limits their efficiency and flexibility. In particular, token-by-token decoding incurs high latency, while the fixed left-to-right generation order causes early prediction errors to propagate and is difficult to revise. To address these limitations, we explore the use of diffusion language models (dLLMs) for document reranking and propose DiffuRank, a reranking framework built upon dLLMs. Unlike autoregressive models, dLLMs support more flexible decoding and generation processes that are not constrained to a left-to-right order, and enable parallel decoding, which may lead to improved efficiency and controllability. Specifically, we investigate three reranking strategies based on dLLMs: (1) a pointwise approach that uses dLLMs to estimate the relevance of each query-document pair; (2) a logit-based listwise approach that prompts dLLMs to jointly assess the relevance of multiple documents and derives ranking lists directly from model logits; and (3) a permutation-based listwise approach that adapts the canonical decoding process of dLLMs to the reranking tasks. For each approach, we design corresponding training methods to fully exploit the advantages of dLLMs. We evaluate both zero-shot and fine-tuned reranking performance on multiple benchmarks. Experimental results show that dLLMs achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of autoregressive LLMs with similar model sizes. These findings demonstrate the promise of diffusion-based language models as a compelling alternative to autoregressive architectures for document reranking.",

Depending on the input, they may over-rely on linguistic priors relative to visual evidence, or conversely over-attend to visually salient but facts in textual contexts. Prior work has applied a uniform steering intensity to adjust the modality preference of MLLMs. However, strong steering can impair standard inference and increase error rates, whereas weak steering is often ineffective. In addition, because steering sensitivity varies substantially across multimodal instances, a single global strength is difficult to calibrate. To address this limitation with minimal disruption to inference, we introduce an instance-aware diagnostic metric that quantifies each modality's information contribution and reveals sample-specific susceptibility to steering. Building on these insights, we propose a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module that infers scaling patterns, enabling instance-aware control of modality preference. Experimental results show that our instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low.",

In practice, however, expert specialization often fails: some experts become functionally similar, while others functioning as de facto shared experts, limiting the effective capacity and model performance. In this work, we analysis from a spectral perspective on parameter and gradient spaces, uncover that (1) experts share highly overlapping dominant spectral components in their parameters, (2) dominant gradient subspaces are strongly aligned across experts, driven by ubiquitous low-rank structure in human corpus, and (3) gating mechanisms preferentially route inputs along these dominant directions, further limiting specialization. To address this, we propose Spectral-Decoupled MoE (SD-MoE), which decomposes both parameter and gradient in the spectral space. SD-MoE improves performance across downstream tasks, enables effective expert specialization, incurring minimal additional computation, and can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing MoE architectures, including Qwen and DeepSeek.",

We identify a critical decoupling failure in current research: the lack of distinction between appearance-based shifts, such as weather and lighting, and structural scene changes. This leaves a fundamental question unanswered: Is the planner failing because of complex road geometry, or simply because it is raining? To resolve this, we establish navdream, a high-fidelity robustness benchmark leveraging generative pixel-aligned style transfer. By creating a visual stress test with negligible geometric deviation, we isolate the impact of appearance on driving performance. Our evaluation reveals that existing planning algorithms often show significant degradation under OOD appearance conditions, even when the underlying scene structure remains consistent. To bridge this gap, we propose a universal perception interface leveraging a frozen visual foundation model (DINOv3). By extracting appearance-invariant features as a stable interface for the planner, we achieve exceptional zero-shot generalization across diverse planning paradigms, including regression-based, diffusion-based, and scoring-based models. Our plug-and-play solution maintains consistent performance across extreme appearance shifts without requiring further fine-tuning. The benchmark and code will be made available.",

We can achieve expert-level performance in some specific domains via RLVR, such as coding or math. When a general multi-domain expert-level model is required, we need to carefully consider the collaboration of RLVR across different domains. The current state-of-the-art models mainly employ two different training paradigms for multi-domain RLVR: mixed multi-task RLVR and separate RLVR followed by model merging. However, most of the works did not provide a detailed comparison and analysis about these paradigms. To this end, we choose multiple commonly used high-level tasks (e.g., math, coding, science, and instruction following) as our target domains and design extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments using open-source datasets. We find the RLVR across domains exhibits few mutual interferences, and reasoning-intensive domains demonstrate mutually synergistic effects. Furthermore, we analyze the internal mechanisms of mutual gains from the perspectives of weight space geometry, model prediction behavior, and information constraints.

However, in such settings, standard methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization face a critical challenge: destructive gradient variance that often leads to training collapse. To address this issue, we introduceVerifier-Independent Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (VI-CuRL), a framework that leverages the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers.

McDiffuSE uses look-ahead simulations to evaluate partial completions before commitment, systematically exploring the combinatorial space of generation orders. Experiments show an average improvement of 3.2% over autoregressive baselines and 8.0% over baseline plan-and-infill, with notable gains of 19.5% on MBPP and 4.9% on MATH500. Our analysis reveals that while McDiffuSE predominantly follows sequential ordering, incorporating non-sequential generation is essential for maximising performance.

We attribute this gap to a pre-routing bottleneck: multi-head attention concatenates head-specific signals into a single post-attention router input, forcing routing to act on co-occurring feature compositions rather than separable head channels. We show that this router input simultaneously encodes multiple separately decodable semantic and structural factors with uneven head support, and that different feature compositions induce weakly aligned parameter-gradient directions; as a result, routing maps many distinct compositions to the same route. We quantify this collision effect via a route-wise effective composition number $N_{eff}$ and find that higher $N_{eff}$ is associated with larger old-task loss increases after continual training. Motivated by these findings, we propose MH-MoE, which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations to increase routing granularity and reduce composition collisions. On TRACE with Qwen3-0.6B/8B, MH-MoE effectively mitigates forgetting, reducing BWT on Qwen3-0.6B from 11.2% (LoRAMoE) to 4.5%.",

To leverage conventional image processing pipelines, events are typically binned into frames. However, binning functions are discontinuous, which truncates gradients at the frame level and forces most event-based algorithms to rely solely on frame-based features. Attempts to directly learn from raw events avoid this restriction but instead suffer from biased gradient estimation due to the discontinuities of the binning operation, ultimately limiting their learning efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for unbiased gradient estimation of arbitrary binning functions by synthesizing weak derivatives during backpropagation while keeping the forward output unchanged. The key idea is to exploit integration by parts: lifting the target functions to functionals yields an integral form of the derivative of the binning function during backpropagation, where the cotangent function naturally arises. By reconstructing this cotangent function from the sampled cotangent vector, we compute weak derivatives that provably match long-range finite differences of both smooth and non-smooth targets. Experimentally, our method improves simple optimization-based egomotion estimation with 3.2\\% lower RMS error and 1.57$\\times$ faster convergence. On complex downstream tasks, we achieve 9.4\\% lower EPE in self-supervised optical flow, and 5.1\\% lower RMS error in SLAM, demonstrating broad benefits for event-based visual perception.

The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions. Group activity recognition further shows robust performance across diverse crowd scenarios. In addition, a preliminary exploratory user study with eight visually impaired and low-vision participants evaluates the agentic interaction framework through structured tasks and a UTAUT-based questionnaire reveals high acceptance and positive perceptions of usability, trust, and perceived sociability during our experiments. The results highlight the potential of PISHYAR as a multimodal assistive mobility aid that extends beyond navigation to provide socially interactive support for such users.",

An example is the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles whose behavior may change based on factors such as traffic density, road visibility, and social norms. Therefore, the environment encountered during deployment rarely mirrors the environment and data encountered during training -- a phenomenon known as distribution shift -- which can undermine the safety of autonomous systems. Conformal prediction (CP) has recently been used along with data from the training environment to provide prediction regions that capture the behavior of the environment with a desired probability. When embedded within a model predictive controller (MPC), one can provide probabilistic safety guarantees, but only when the deployment and training environments coincide. Once a distribution shift occurs, these guarantees collapse. We propose a planning framework that is robust under distribution shifts by: (i) assuming that the underlying data distribution of the environment is parameterized by a nuisance parameter, i.e., an observable, interpretable quantity such as traffic density, (ii) training a conditional diffusion model that captures distribution shifts as a function of the nuisance parameter, (iii) observing the nuisance parameter online and generating cheap, synthetic data from the diffusion model for the observed nuisance parameter, and (iv) designing an MPC that embeds CP regions constructed from such synthetic data. Importantly, we account for discrepancies between the underlying data distribution and the diffusion model by using robust CP. Thus, the plans computed using robust CP enjoy probabilistic safety guarantees, in contrast with plans obtained from a single, static set of training data. We empirically demonstrate safety under diverse distribution shifts in the ORCA simulator.",

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy. Crucially, under high compression ratios, our method remains robust while heuristic-based techniques degrade sharply.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable performance across various domains, yet their practical deployment is often limited by high sampling costs. While prior work focuses on training objectives or individual solvers, the holistic design of sampling, specifically solver selection and scheduling, remains dominated by static heuristics. In this work, we revisit this challenge through a geometric lens, proposing SDM, a principled framework that aligns the numerical solver with the intrinsic properties of the diffusion trajectory. By analyzing the ODE dynamics, we show that efficient low-order solvers suffice in early high-noise stages while higher-order solvers can be progressively deployed to handle the increasing non-linearity of later stages. Furthermore, we formalize the scheduling by introducing a Wasserstein-bounded optimization framework. This method systematically derives adaptive timesteps that explicitly bound the local discretization error, ensuring the sampling process remains faithful to the underlying continuous dynamics. Without requiring additional training or architectural modifications, SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, including an FID of 1.93 on CIFAR-10, 2.41 on FFHQ, and 1.98 on AFHQv2, with a reduced number of function evaluations compared to existing samplers.

However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \\underline{\\textit{RL}}-based sim-real \\underline{\\textit{Co}}-training \\modify{(RL-Co)} framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and $\\pi_{0.5}$, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on $\\pi_{0.5}$. Beyond higher success rates, RL co-training yields stronger generalization to unseen task variations and substantially improved real-world data efficiency, providing a practical and scalable pathway for leveraging simulation to enhance real-robot deployment.",

However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines.\nWe study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes.\nWe further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial.",

Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently.",

        "abstract": "Legal text generated by large language models (LLMs) can usually achieve reasonable factual accuracy, but it frequently fails to adhere to the specialised stylistic norms and linguistic conventions of legal writing. In order to improve stylistic quality, a crucial first step is to establish a reliable evaluation method. However, having legal experts manually develop such a metric is impractical, as the implicit stylistic requirements in legal writing practice are difficult to formalise into explicit rubrics. Meanwhile, existing automatic evaluation methods also fall short: reference-based metrics conflate semantic accuracy with stylistic fidelity, and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations suffer from opacity and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce CLASE (Chinese LegAlese Stylistic Evaluation), a hybrid evaluation method that focuses on the stylistic performance of legal text. The method incorporates a hybrid scoring mechanism that combines 1) linguistic feature-based scores and 2) experience-guided LLM-as-a-judge scores. Both the feature coefficients and the LLM scoring experiences are learned from contrastive pairs of authentic legal documents and their LLM-restored counterparts. This hybrid design captures both surface-level features and implicit stylistic norms in a transparent, reference-free manner. Experiments on 200 Chinese legal documents show that CLASE achieves substantially higher alignment with human judgments than traditional metrics and pure LLM-as-a-judge methods. Beyond improved alignment, CLASE provides interpretable score breakdowns and suggestions for improvements, offering a scalable and practical solution for professional stylistic evaluation in legal text generation (Code and data for CLASE is available at: https://github.com/rexera/CLASE).",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for text-to-image generation. However, their iterative sampling process, which gradually morphs random noise into coherent images, introduces significant latency that limits their applicability. While recent few-step diffusion models reduce the number of sampling steps to as few as one to four steps, they often compromise image quality and prompt alignment, especially in one-step generation. Additionally, these models require computationally expensive training procedures. To address these limitations, we propose ImageRAGTurbo, a novel approach to efficiently finetune few-step diffusion models via retrieval augmentation. Given a text prompt, we retrieve relevant text-image pairs from a database and use them to condition the generation process. We argue that such retrieved examples provide rich contextual information to the UNet denoiser that helps reduce the number of denoising steps without compromising image quality. Indeed, our initial investigations show that using the retrieved content to edit the denoiser's latent space ($\\mathcal{H}$-space) without additional finetuning already improves prompt fidelity. To further improve the quality of the generated images, we augment the UNet denoiser with a trainable adapter in the $\\mathcal{H}$-space, which efficiently blends the retrieved content with the target prompt using a cross-attention mechanism. Experimental results on fast text-to-image generation demonstrate that our approach produces high-fidelity images without compromising latency compared to existing methods.",

Recent works address this issue by adopting GFlowNets, training LLMs to match a target distribution while jointly learning its partition function. In contrast to prior works that treat this partition function solely as a normalizer, we reinterpret it as a per-prompt expected-reward (i.e., online accuracy) signal, leveraging this unused information to improve sample efficiency. Specifically, we first establish a theoretical relationship between the partition function and per-prompt accuracy estimates. Building on this key insight, we propose Partition Function-Guided RL (PACED-RL), a post-training framework that leverages accuracy estimates to prioritize informative question prompts during training, and further improves sample efficiency through an accuracy estimate error-prioritized replay. Crucially, both components reuse information already produced during GFlowNet training, effectively amortizing the compute overhead into the existing optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate strong performance improvements over GRPO and prior GFlowNet approaches, highlighting PACED-RL as a promising direction for a more sample efficient distribution-matching training for LLMs.",

By embedding state-action pairs into a latent space in which the true value function is approximately linear, our method supports a single set of hyperparameters across diverse domains -- from continuous control with low-dimensional and pixel inputs to high-dimensional Atari games. We prove that, under mild conditions, the fixed point of our embedding-based temporal-difference updates coincides with that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, and we derive explicit error bounds relating embedding fidelity to value approximation quality. In practice, ULD employs synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and reward-scale normalization to ensure stable learning under sparse rewards. Evaluated on 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari, our approach matches or exceeds the performance of specialized model-free and general model-based baselines -- achieving cross-domain competence with minimal tuning and a fraction of the parameter footprint. These results indicate that value-aligned latent representations alone can deliver the adaptability and sample efficiency traditionally attributed to full model-based planning.",

To address these limitations, we propose the Parameterized Motion Generator (PMG), a real-time motion generator grounded in an analysis of human motion structure that synthesizes reference trajectories using only a compact set of parameterized motion data together with High-dimensional control commands. Combined with an imitation-learning pipeline and an optimization-based sim-to-real motor parameter identification module, we validate the complete approach on our humanoid prototype ZERITH Z1 and show that, within a single integrated system, PMG produces natural, human-like locomotion, responds precisely to high-dimensional control inputs-including VR-based teleoperation-and enables efficient, verifiable sim-to-real transfer.

Existing approaches follow either Generative (GRMs) or Discriminative (DRMs) paradigms, yet both suffer from limitations: GRMs typically demand costly point-wise supervision, while DRMs produce uncalibrated relative scores that lack probabilistic interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel reward modeling paradigm: Probabilistic Reward Model (PRM). Instead of modeling reward as a deterministic scalar, our approach treats it as a random variable, learning a full probability distribution for the quality of each response. To make this paradigm practical, we present its closed-form, discrete realization: the Ordinal Probabilistic Reward Model (OPRM), which discretizes the quality score into a finite set of ordinal ratings. Building on OPRM, we propose a data-efficient training strategy called Region Flooding Tuning (RgFT). It enables rewards to better reflect absolute text quality by incorporating quality-level annotations, which guide the model to concentrate the probability mass within corresponding rating sub-regions. Experiments on various reward model benchmarks show that our method improves accuracy by $\\textbf{2.9%}\\sim\\textbf{7.4%}$ compared to prior reward models, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Analysis of the score distribution provides evidence that our method captures not only relative rankings but also absolute quality.",

However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency.

Currently, research on link prediction for complex dynamic networks integrating temporal evolution, relational polarity and edge weight information remains significantly underexplored, failing to meet practical demands. For dynamic signed-weighted networks, this paper proposes a tripartite joint prediction framework for unified forecasting of links, signs and weights. First, the dynamic network is decomposed into temporal snapshots, and node semantic embeddings are generated via sign-aware weighted random walks. We then design multi-hop structural balance and temporal difference features to capture the structural characteristics and dynamic evolution laws of the network, respectively. The model adopts a dual-channel feature decoupling mechanism: node semantic embeddings are used for link existence prediction, while relational sign features are fed into a Transformer encoder to model temporal dependencies. Finally, prediction results are output synergistically through a multi-task unit. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, compared with baseline methods, the proposed framework achieves an average 2%-4% improvement in the performance of link existence and relational sign prediction, and a significant 40%-50% reduction in edge weight prediction error.",

Our generators isolate distinct competencies and failure modes: (i) contradiction-cycle UNSAT cores with controllable size and imbalance, (ii) SAT instances with a prescribed fraction of free variables to control solution multiplicity, (iii) planted backbones that modulate propagation, (iv) late bridge clauses that couple otherwise monotone regions to probe sensitivity to ordering and revision, and (v) symmetry/duplication variants that test abstraction under renaming and redundant structure. We evaluate LLM-based reasoners on decision accuracy and assignment validity, and quantify robustness under semantics-preserving perturbations such as clause reordering, filler clauses, and variable renaming.

Manually tuning these parameters for optimal performance demands considerable expertise, while traditional auto-tuning approaches struggle with the enormous search space and low sample efficiency inherent to this domain. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and logical reasoning, offering new possibilities for system optimization. However, applying LLMs to real-time compaction tuning in such latency-sensitive environments is a double-edged sword. While large-scale LLMs can offer superior reasoning for strategy generation, their high inference latency and computational cost make them impractical for interactive, low-latency tuning. In contrast, small-scale LLMs achieve low latency but often at the expense of reasoning accuracy and tuning effectiveness. In this paper, we first evaluate this trade-off by analyzing the compaction-tuning performance and inference latency of LLMs at different scales in an LSM-tree-based tuning case. We then characterize the performance of LSM-tree on RocksDB v8.8.1, with a focus on adjusting the key compaction-related parameters under db_bench workloads. Our experimental results show a clear positive correlation between model capability and tuning effectiveness.",

While existing distillation approaches focus on imitating teacher behavior, they often overlook the original learning environment that shaped the teacher's knowledge. Inspired by the experiential learning theory and inverse reinforcement learning, we propose Experiential Knowledge Distillation ($\\mathcal{X}$-KD), a novel and general framework that enables student models to learn in the teacher's original learning environment. $\\mathcal{X}$-KD adopts the Approximated Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL) framework to jointly model the teacher's original reward function and perform policy distillation, encouraging consistency between the student policy and the original reward function. Our derivation demonstrates that $\\mathcal{X}$-KD follows the supervised learning framework and applies to both sequence-level and divergence-based distillation methods, underlining the simplicity and flexibility of our approach. Empirical results show that $\\mathcal{X}$-KD outperforms the generalized KD and MiniLLM baselines on abstractive summarization, machine translation, and arithmetic reasoning tasks.

In particular, inference-time sampling strategies, which leverage the generative priors of large-scale pre-trained I2V models without additional training, have become increasingly popular. However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths. This is because each path follows the motion prior induced by its own conditioning frame. In this work, we propose Motion Prior Distillation (MPD), a simple yet effective inference-time distillation technique that suppresses bidirectional mismatch by distilling the motion residual of the forward path into the backward path. Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior. We not only perform quantitative evaluations on standard benchmarks, but also conduct extensive user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.",

The key to our method lies in a carefully designed training recipe and deployment strategy. Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks. Moreover, Xiaomi-Robotics-0 can roll out fast and smoothly on real robots using a consumer-grade GPU, achieving high success rates and throughput on both real-robot tasks.

We formalize this as sign grounding, the problem of mapping semantic instructions on signs to corresponding scene elements and navigational actions. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the semantic common-sense and reasoning capabilities required for this task, but are sensitive to how spatial information is represented. We propose SignScene, a sign-centric spatial-semantic representation that captures navigation-relevant scene elements and sign information, and presents them to VLMs in a form conducive to effective reasoning. We evaluate our grounding approach on a dataset of 114 queries collected across nine diverse environment types, achieving 88% grounding accuracy and significantly outperforming baselines.

Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

In high-performance racing shoes, these foams are critical for low weight, high cushioning, and efficient energy return; yet, their constitutive behavior remains difficult to model and poorly understood. Here we integrate mechanical testing and machine learning to discover the mechanics of two ultra-low density elastomeric polymeric foams used in elite-level racing shoes. Across uniaxial tension, confined and unconfined compression, and simple shear, both foams exhibit pronounced tension-compression asymmetry, negligible lateral strains consistent with an effective Poisson's ratio close to zero, and low hysteresis indicative of an efficient energy return. Both foams provide a similar compressive stiffness (268kPa vs. 299kPa), while one foam exhibits nearly double the shear stiffness (219kPa vs. 117kPa), implying a substantially greater lateral stability at a comparable vertical energy return (83% vs. 89%). By integrating these data into constitutive neural networks, paired with sparse regression, we discover compact, interpretable single-invariant models, supplemented by mixed-invariant or principal-stretch based terms, that capture the unique signature of the foams with R2 values close to one. From a human performance perspective, these models enable finite-element and gait-level simulations of high-performance racing shoes to quantify running economy, performance enhancements, and injury risks on an individual athlete level. More broadly, this work establishes a scalable and interpretable approach for constitutive modeling of highly compressible, ultra-light elastomeric foams with applications to wearable technologies, soft robotics, and energy-efficient mobility systems.",

To address these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO), which enhances the Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) by embedding governing physics into training through PDE, boundary condition, and initial condition residuals. To improve expressivity, we first introduce an Advanced LNO (ALNO) backbone that retains a pole-residue transient representation while replacing the steady-state branch with an FNO-style Fourier multiplier. To make physics-informed training both data-efficient and robust, PILNO further leverages (i) virtual inputs: an unlabeled ensemble of input functions spanning a broad spectral range that provides abundant physics-only supervision and explicitly targets out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes; and (ii) temporal-causality weighting: a time-decaying reweighting of the physics residual that prioritizes early-time dynamics and stabilizes optimization for time-dependent PDEs. Across four representative benchmarks -- Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, a reaction-diffusion system, and a forced KdV equation -- PILNO consistently improves accuracy in small-data settings (e.g., N_train <= 27), reduces run-to-run variability across random seeds, and achieves stronger OOD generalization than purely data-driven baselines.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a dominant paradigm for grounding large language models (LLMs) with external evidence in knowledge-intensive question answering. A core design choice is how to fuse retrieved samples into the LLMs, where existing internal fusion approaches broadly fall into query-based fusion, parametric fusion, and latent-based fusion. Despite their effectiveness at modest retrieval scales, these methods often fail to scale gracefully as the number of retrieved candidates k increases: Larger k improves evidence coverage, yet realistic top-k retrieval inevitably contains irrelevant or redundant content and increases the inference cost.\nTo address these limitations, we propose ReFilter, a novel latent-based fusion framework that performs token-level filtering and fusion. ReFilter consists of three key components: a context encoder for encoding context features, a gated filter for weighting each token, and a token fusion module for integrating the weighted token feature into the LLM's hidden states. Our experiments across four general-domain QA benchmarks show that ReFilter consistently achieves the best average performance under both in-domain adaptation and out-of-domain transfer. ReFilter further generalizes to five biomedical QA benchmarks in zero-shot transfer without domain fine-tuning, reaching 70.01% average accuracy with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct.",

In contrast, self-supervised speech encoders such as WavLM provide strong acoustic representations yet remain opaque discriminative models with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools), a framework that reframes emotion recognition as a multi-turn inquiry process rather than a single-pass prediction. ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise. Finally, we integrate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an Evidence Trust Gate to explicitly couple tool-usage behaviors with prediction quality and enforce evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments show that ADEPT improves primary emotion accuracy in most settings while substantially improving minor emotion characterization, producing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence.",

Conventional quadrupedal navigation typically separates motion planning from locomotion control, neglecting whole-body constraints and terrain awareness. On the other hand, end-to-end methods are more integrated but require high-frequency sensing, which is often noisy and computationally costly. In addition, most existing approaches assume static environments, limiting their use in human-populated settings. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage training framework with three DRL pipelines. (1) TRANS-Loco employs an asymmetric actor-critic (AC) model for quadrupedal locomotion, enabling traversal of uneven terrains without explicit terrain or contact observations. (2) TRANS-Nav applies a symmetric AC framework for social navigation, directly mapping transformed LiDAR data to ego-agent actions under differential-drive kinematics. (3) A unified pipeline, TRANS, integrates TRANS-Loco and TRANS-Nav, supporting terrain-aware quadrupedal navigation in uneven and socially interactive environments. Comprehensive benchmarks against locomotion and social navigation baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of TRANS. Hardware experiments further confirm its potential for sim-to-real transfer.",

However, retriever training has been bottlenecked by sparse, single-positive annotations, which lead to false-negative noise and suboptimal supervision. While the advent of large language models (LLMs) makes it feasible to collect comprehensive multi-positive relevance labels at scale, the optimal strategy for incorporating these dense signals into training remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic study of multi-positive optimization objectives for retriever training. We unify representative objectives, including Joint Likelihood (JointLH), Summed Marginal Likelihood (SumMargLH), and Log-Sum-Exp Pairwise (LSEPair) loss, under a shared contrastive learning framework. Our theoretical analysis characterizes their distinct gradient behaviors, revealing how each allocates probability mass across positive document sets. Empirically, we conduct extensive evaluations on Natural Questions, MS MARCO, and the BEIR benchmark across two realistic regimes: homogeneous LLM-annotated data and heterogeneous mixtures of human and LLM labels. Our results show that LSEPair consistently achieves superior robustness and performance across settings, while JointLH and SumMargLH exhibit high sensitivity to the quality of positives. Furthermore, we find that the simple strategy of random sampling (Rand1LH) serves as a reliable baseline. By aligning theoretical insights with empirical findings, we provide practical design principles for leveraging dense, LLM-augmented supervision to enhance retriever effectiveness.",

We evaluate Real2Gen on human demonstrations from three different real-world tasks and compare it to a recent baseline. Real2Gen shows an average increase in the success rate of 26.6% and better generalization of the trained policy due to the abundance and diversity of training data.

We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models. SemanticLens demonstrates how contract-based service boundaries enable independent evolution, offline/online separation ensures responsiveness, and persistent state management supports traceability.

However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility. Beyond providing a useful basis for task-transfer, we show that HSR's temporally extended predictive structure can also be leveraged to drive efficient exploration, effectively scaling to large, procedurally generated environments.",

This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \\textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller.

In this paper, we present PixelRush, the first tuning-free framework for practical high-resolution text-to-image generation.

Positive or negative media framing may shape and shift how individuals evaluate HRC. This study examines how message framing moderates the effects of perceived risks and perceived benefits on overall attributed value. In a pre-registered study, participants (N = 1150) were randomly assigned to read either a positively or negatively framed newspaper article in one of three industrial contexts (autonomy, employment, safety) about HRC in production. Subsequently, perceived risks, benefits, and value were measured using reliable and publicly available psychometric scales. Two multiple regressions (one per framing condition) tested for main and interaction effects. Framing influenced absolute evaluations of risk, benefits, and value. In both frames, risks and benefits significantly predicted attributed value. Under positive framing, only main effects were observed (risks: beta = -0.52; benefits: beta = 0.45). Under negative framing, both predictors had stronger main effects (risks: beta = -0.69; benefits: beta = 0.63) along with a significant negative interaction (beta = -0.32), indicating that higher perceived risk diminishes the positive effect of perceived benefits. Model fit was higher for the positive frame (R^2 = 0.715) than for the negative frame (R^2 = 0.583), indicating greater explained variance in value attributions. Framing shapes the absolute evaluation of HRC and how risks and benefits are cognitively integrated in trade-offs. Negative framing produces stronger but interdependent effects, whereas positive framing supports additive evaluations. These findings highlight the role of strategic communication in fostering acceptance of HRC and underscore the need to consider framing in future HRC research.",

        "abstract": "The emerging integration of robots into everyday life brings several major challenges. Compared to classical industrial applications, more flexibility is needed in combination with real-time reactivity. Learning-based methods can train powerful policies based on demonstrated trajectories, such that the robot generalizes a task to similar situations. However, these black-box models lack interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Optimization-based methods provide these guarantees but lack the required flexibility and generalization capabilities. This work proposes SafeFlowMPC, a combination of flow matching and online optimization to combine the strengths of learning and optimization. This method guarantees safety at all times and is designed to meet the demands of real-time execution by using a suboptimal model-predictive control formulation. SafeFlowMPC achieves strong performance in three real-world experiments on a KUKA 7-DoF manipulator, namely two grasping experiment and a dynamic human-robot object handover experiment. A video of the experiments is available at http://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d6. The code is available at https://github.com/TU-Wien-ACIN-CDS/SafeFlowMPC.",

        "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a prominent research direction owing to its ultrarapid training speed and high-fidelity rendering capabilities. However, the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds poses challenges to reconstruction accuracy. This limitation frequently causes high-frequency detail loss in complex surface microstructures when relying solely on routine strategies. To address this limitation, we propose GSM-GS: a synergistic optimization framework integrating single-view adaptive sub-region weighting constraints and multi-view spatial structure refinement. For single-view optimization, we leverage image gradient features to partition scenes into texture-rich and texture-less sub-regions. The reconstruction quality is enhanced through adaptive filtering mechanisms guided by depth discrepancy features. This preserves high-weight regions while implementing a dual-branch constraint strategy tailored to regional texture variations, thereby improving geometric detail characterization. For multi-view optimization, we introduce a geometry-guided cross-view point cloud association method combined with a dynamic weight sampling strategy. This constructs 3D structural normal constraints across adjacent point cloud frames, effectively reinforcing multi-view consistency and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves both competitive rendering quality and geometric reconstruction. See our interactive project page",

Text is typically scrubbed of identifying information prior to use, often with tools such as Microsoft's Presidio or Anthropic's PII purifier. These tools have traditionally been evaluated on their ability to remove specific identifiers (e.g., names), yet their effectiveness at preventing re-identification remains unclear. We introduce RAT-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for text anonymization tools based on re-identification risk. Using U.S. demographic statistics, we generate synthetic text containing various direct and indirect identifiers across domains, languages, and difficulty levels. We evaluate a range of NER- and LLM-based text anonymization tools and, based on the attributes an LLM-based attacker is able to correctly infer from the anonymized text, we report the risk of re-identification in the U.S. population, while properly accounting for the disparate impact of identifiers. We find that, while capabilities vary widely, even the best tools are far from perfect in particular when direct identifiers are not written in standard ways and when indirect identifiers enable re-identification. Overall we find LLM-based anonymizers, including new iterative anonymizers, to provide a better privacy-utility trade-off albeit at a higher computational cost. Importantly, we also find them to work well across languages. We conclude with recommendations for future anonymization tools and will release the benchmark and encourage community efforts to expand it, in particular to other geographies.",

        "abstract": "Detecting reclaimed slurs represents a fundamental challenge for hate speech detection systems, as the same lexcal items can function either as abusive expressions or as in-group affirmations depending on social identity and context. In this work, we address Subtask B of the MultiPRIDE shared task at EVALITA 2026 by proposing a hierarchical approach to modeling the slur reclamation process. Our core assumption is that members of the LGBTQ+ community are more likely, on average, to employ certain slurs in a eclamatory manner. Based on this hypothesis, we decompose the task into two stages. First, using a weakly supervised LLM-based annotation, we assign fuzzy labels to users indicating the likelihood of belonging to the LGBTQ+ community, inferred from the tweet and the user bio. These soft labels are then used to train a BERT-like model to predict community membership, encouraging the model to learn latent representations associated with LGBTQ+ identity. In the second stage, we integrate this latent space with a newly initialized model for the downstream slur reclamation detection task. The intuition is that the first model encodes user-oriented sociolinguistic signals, which are then fused with representations learned by a model pretrained for hate speech detection. Experimental results on Italian and Spanish show that our approach achieves performance statistically comparable to a strong BERT-based baseline, while providing a modular and extensible framework for incorporating sociolinguistic context into hate speech modeling. We argue that more fine-grained hierarchical modeling of user identity and discourse context may further improve the detection of reclaimed language.

To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized SchrÃ¶dinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation.",

While effective at amplifying dominant behaviors, we identify a critical pathology in this alignment process: the systematic suppression of valid but rare (low-likelihood under the base model distribution) reasoning paths. We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a \"Normalization Squeeze,\" where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. Crucially, on the long-tail subset where coupled RL optimization collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance, suggesting that disentangling verification from generation offers a more robust pathway for solving complex reasoning tasks.",

However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy. Our RADAR underscores the need for a decomposed perspective on pre-training ability bottlenecks, informing targeted interventions to advance MLLMs efficiently.

To address these challenges, we propose HRL4AG, a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework for cooperative Air-Ground delivery.

However, the success of existing TWI methods heavily relies on the assumption that interleaved image-text CoTs are faultless, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of multimodal understanding. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT). Specifically, NT refers to the imperfect visual cues mining and answer reasoning process. As the saying goes, ``One mistake leads to another'', erroneous interleaved CoT would cause error accumulation, thus significantly degrading the performance of MLLMs. To solve the NT problem, we propose a novel method dubbed Reliable Thinking with Images (RTWI). In brief, RTWI estimates the reliability of visual cues and textual CoT in a unified text-centric manner and accordingly employs robust filtering and voting modules to prevent NT from contaminating the final answer. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks verify the effectiveness of RTWI against NT.",

        "abstract": "Distinguishing the feel of smooth silk from coarse cotton is a trivial everyday task for humans. When exploring such fabrics, fingertip skin senses both spatio-temporal force patterns and texture-induced vibrations that are integrated to form a haptic representation of the explored material. It is challenging to reproduce this rich, dynamic perceptual capability in robots because tactile sensors typically cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and high temporal sampling rate. In this work, we present a system that can sense both types of haptic information, and we investigate how each type influences robotic tactile perception of fabrics. Our robotic hand's middle finger and thumb each feature a soft tactile sensor: one is the open-source Minsight sensor that uses an internal camera to measure fingertip deformation and force at 50 Hz, and the other is our new sensor Minsound that captures vibrations through an internal MEMS microphone with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Inspired by the movements humans make to evaluate fabrics, our robot actively encloses and rubs folded fabric samples between its two sensitive fingers. Our results test the influence of each sensing modality on overall classification performance, showing high utility for the audio-based sensor. Our transformer-based method achieves a maximum fabric classification accuracy of 97 % on a dataset of 20 common fabrics. Incorporating an external microphone away from Minsound increases our method's robustness in loud ambient noise conditions. To show that this audio-visual tactile sensing approach generalizes beyond the training data, we learn general representations of fabric stretchiness, thickness, and roughness.",

Recognizing the current scarcity of dedicated datasets in this domain, we introduce EPRBench, a high-quality benchmark specifically designed for event stream-based VPR. EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning. This framework not only achieves highly accurate place recognition but also produces interpretable reasoning processes alongside its predictions, significantly enhancing model transparency and explainability.

On the one hand, they might motivate users to pursue personal goals, such as healthier lifestyles. On the other hand, they are associated with potential risks like manipulation and deception, which are induced by limited control over probabilistic agent outputs. However, as GSAs manifest communicative patterns based on available knowledge, their behavior may be regulated through their access to such knowledge. Following this approach, we explored persuasive ChatGPT-generated messages in the context of human-robot physiotherapy motivation. We did so by comparing ChatGPT-generated responses to predefined inputs from a hypothetical physiotherapy patient. In Study 1, we qualitatively analyzed 13 ChatGPT-generated dialogue scripts with varying knowledge configurations regarding persuasive message characteristics. In Study 2, third-party observers (N = 27) rated a selection of these dialogues in terms of the agent's expressiveness, assertiveness, and persuasiveness. Our findings indicate that LLM-based GSAs can adapt assertive and expressive personality traits -- significantly enhancing perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, persuasiveness significantly benefited from the availability of information about the patients' age and past profession, mediated by perceived assertiveness and expressiveness. Contextual knowledge about physiotherapy benefits did not significantly impact persuasiveness, possibly because the LLM had inherent knowledge about such benefits even without explicit prompting. Overall, the study highlights the importance of empirically studying behavioral patterns of GSAs, specifically in terms of what information generative AI systems require for consistent and responsible communication.",

However, ADI remains constrained by the availability of single-label datasets, with no large-scale multi-label resources available for training. By analyzing models trained on single-label ADI data, we show that the main difficulty in repurposing such datasets for Multi-Label Arabic Dialect Identification (MLADI) lies in the selection of negative samples, as many sentences treated as negative could be acceptable in multiple dialects. To address these issues, we construct a multi-label dataset by generating automatic multi-label annotations using GPT-4o and binary dialect acceptability classifiers, with aggregation guided by the Arabic Level of Dialectness (ALDi). Afterward, we train a BERT-based multi-label classifier using curriculum learning strategies aligned with dialectal complexity and label cardinality.

These schemas enable agents to dynamically invoke human input based on relative strengths and reintegrate it through efficient, natural interaction protocols. We validate the framework through controlled studies in both decision-making and creative tasks, demonstrating improved task performance, reduced human workload, and more balanced collaboration dynamics compared to baseline systems.

Benefiting from strong semantic modeling and robust generalization, VLM-based end-to-end approaches have emerged as the mainstream paradigm in recent years. However, these models often suffer from substantial inference latency, as they must auto-regressively generate long token sequences when processing long-form documents. In this work, motivated by the extremely long outputs and complex layout structures commonly found in document parsing, we propose a training-free and highly efficient acceleration method. Inspired by speculative decoding, we employ a lightweight document parsing pipeline as a draft model to predict batches of future tokens, while the more accurate VLM verifies these draft predictions in parallel. Moreover, we further exploit the layout-structured nature of documents by partitioning each page into independent regions, enabling parallel decoding of each region using the same draft-verify strategy. The final predictions are then assembled according to the natural reading order. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: on the general-purpose OmniDocBench, our method provides a 2.42x lossless acceleration for the http://dots.ocr model, and achieves up to 4.89x acceleration on long-document parsing tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose TriGen, a novel NPU architecture tailored for resource-constrained environments through software-hardware co-design. Firstly, TriGen adopts low-precision computation using microscaling (MX) to enable additional optimization opportunities while preserving accuracy, and resolves the issues that arise by employing such precision. Secondly, to jointly optimize both nonlinear and linear operations, TriGen eliminates the need for specialized hardware for essential nonlinear operations by using fast and accurate LUT, thereby maximizing performance gains and reducing hardware-cost in on-device environments, and finally, by taking practical hardware constraints into account, further employs scheduling techniques to maximize computational utilization even under limited on-chip memory capacity. We evaluate the performance of TriGen on various LLMs and show that TriGen achieves an average 2.73x performance speedup and 52% less memory transfer over the baseline NPU design with negligible accuracy loss.",

We propose ProbeLLM, a benchmark-agnostic automated probing framework that elevates weakness discovery from individual failures to structured failure modes. ProbeLLM formulates probing as a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search, explicitly allocating limited probing budgets between global exploration of new failure regions and local refinement of recurring error patterns. By restricting probing to verifiable test cases and leveraging tool-augmented generation and verification, ProbeLLM grounds failure discovery in reliable evidence. Discovered failures are further consolidated into interpretable failure modes via failure-aware embeddings and boundary-aware induction.

However, existing approaches are fundamentally misaligned with the needs of embodied tasks. As they rely on either offline batch processing or implicit feature embeddings, the maps can hardly support interpretable human-intent reasoning in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present INHerit-SG. We redefine the map as a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base where natural-language descriptions are introduced as explicit semantic anchors to better align with human intent. An asynchronous dual-process architecture, together with a Floor-Room-Area-Object hierarchy, decouples geometric segmentation from time-consuming semantic reasoning. An event-triggered map update mechanism reorganizes the graph only when meaningful semantic events occur. This strategy enables our graph to maintain long-term consistency with relatively low computational overhead. For retrieval, we deploy multi-role Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose queries into atomic constraints and handle logical negations, and employ a hard-to-soft filtering strategy to ensure robust reasoning. This explicit interpretability improves the success rate and reliability of complex retrievals, enabling the system to adapt to a broader spectrum of human interaction tasks. We evaluate INHerit-SG on a newly constructed dataset, HM3DSem-SQR, and in real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex queries, and reveal its scalability for downstream navigation tasks.

Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems.",

        "abstract": "Classical autonomous driving systems connect perception and prediction modules via hand-crafted bounding-box interfaces, limiting information flow and propagating errors to downstream tasks. Recent research aims to develop end-to-end models that jointly address perception and prediction; however, they often fail to fully exploit the synergy between appearance and motion cues, relying mainly on short-term visual features. We follow the idea of \"looking backward to look forward\", and propose MASAR, a novel fully differentiable framework for joint 3D detection and trajectory forecasting compatible with any transformer-based 3D detector. MASAR employs an object-centric spatio-temporal mechanism that jointly encodes appearance and motion features. By predicting past trajectories and refining them using guidance from appearance cues, MASAR captures long-term temporal dependencies that enhance future trajectory forecasting. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate MASAR's effectiveness, showing improvements of over 20% in minADE and minFDE while maintaining robust detection performance.

        "abstract": "Accurate production forecasts are essential to continue facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. This paper illustrates how to obtain probabilistic day-ahead forecasts of wind power generation via gradient boosting trees using an ensemble of weather forecasts. To this end, we perform a comparative analysis across three state-of-the-art probabilistic prediction methods-conformalised quantile regression, natural gradient boosting and conditional diffusion models-all of which can be combined with tree-based machine learning. The methods are validated using four years of data for all wind farms present within the Belgian offshore zone. Additionally, the point forecasts are benchmarked against deterministic engineering methods, using either the power curve or an advanced approach incorporating a calibrated analytical wake model. The experimental results show that the machine learning methods improve the mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to the power curve and the calibrated wake model. Considering the three probabilistic prediction methods, the conditional diffusion model is found to yield the best overall probabilistic and point estimate of wind power generation. Moreover, the findings suggest that the use of an ensemble of weather forecasts can improve point forecast accuracy by up to 23%.",

This problem is often addressed by proposing an ad-hoc feature set for a particular swarm behaviour context, usually without further consideration of the solution's resilience outside of the conceived context. Yet, the development of automatic methods to design swarm behaviours is dependent on the ability to measure quantitatively the similarity of swarm behaviours. Hence, we investigate the impact of feature sets for collective behaviours. We select swarm feature sets and similarity measures from prior swarm robotics works, which mainly considered a narrow behavioural context and assess their robustness. We demonstrate that the interplay of feature set and similarity measure makes some combinations more suitable to distinguish groups of similar behaviours. We also propose a self-organised map-based approach to identify regions of the feature space where behaviours cannot be easily distinguished.",

Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches.",

When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.\nThis paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, \"building\" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals.",

Temperature and token policies are jointly optimized from downstream rewards using a coordinate ascent scheme.

To tackle these challenges, we propose TCRL, a novel temporal-coupled adversarial training framework for robust constrained reinforcement learning (TCRL) in worst-case scenarios. First, TCRL introduces a worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without the need to explicitly model adversarial attackers. Second, TCRL establishes a dual-constraint defense mechanism on the reward to counter temporally coupled adversaries while maintaining reward unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across a variety of CRL tasks.",

This benchmark reframes food portion estimation as an implicit-scale 3D reconstruction problem under monocular observations. To reflect real-world conditions, explicit physical references and metric annotations are removed; instead, contextual objects such as plates and utensils are provided, requiring algorithms to infer scale from implicit cues and prior knowledge. The dataset emphasizes multi-food scenes with diverse object geometries, frequent occlusions, and complex spatial arrangements. The benchmark was adopted as a challenge at the MetaFood 2025 Workshop, where multiple teams proposed reconstruction-based solutions. Experimental results show that while strong vision--language baselines achieve competitive performance, geometry-based reconstruction methods provide both improved accuracy and greater robustness, with the top-performing approach achieving 0.21 MAPE in volume estimation and 5.7 L1 Chamfer Distance in geometric accuracy.",

However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

Existing approaches force a trade-off between exact gradients with high memory (MeBP) and low memory with noisy estimates (MeZO). We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure. Our key insight is that the intermediate projection $h = xA$ can be recomputed during backward at minimal cost since rank $r \\ll d_{in}$, eliminating the need to store it. MeSP achieves 49\\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients. Our analysis also reveals that MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity $\\approx$0.001), explaining its slow convergence. MeSP reduces peak memory from 361MB to 136MB for Qwen2.5-0.5B, enabling fine-tuning scenarios previously infeasible on memory-constrained devices.",

In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.",

We propose Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB), which computes gradients for only a subset of layers per step. Our key insight is that residual connections guarantee gradient flow through identity paths, while AdamW momentum provides implicit updates for non-selected layers. We interpret LCSB as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space, providing theoretical justification for convergence. LCSB achieves up to 1.40$\\times$ speedup with less than 2\\% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. Surprisingly, in 4-bit quantized settings, LCSB exhibits superior stability: a 3B model that completely diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting an implicit regularization effect from selective gradient computation.",

In this paper, we present a learning-based control framework for a pneumatically actuated soft quadruped equipped with tactile suction-cup feet, and we validate the approach experimentally on physical hardware. The control policy is trained in simulation through a staged learning process that starts from a reference gait and is progressively refined under randomized environmental conditions. The resulting controller maps proprioceptive and tactile feedback to coordinated pneumatic actuation and suction-cup commands, enabling closed-loop locomotion on flat and inclined surfaces. When deployed on the real robot, the closed-loop policy outperforms an open-loop baseline, increasing forward speed by 41% on a flat surface and by 91% on a 5-degree incline. Ablation studies further demonstrate the role of tactile force estimates and inertial feedback in stabilizing locomotion, with performance improvements of up to 56% compared to configurations without sensory feedback.",

The simulation of these batteries relies on multiphysics modeling to evaluate performance and behavior under various conditions. This paper presents advancements in scalable preconditioning strategies for the Thermally Activated Battery Simulator (TABS) tool, enabling efficient solutions to the coupled electrochemical systems that dominate computational costs in thermal battery simulations. We propose a hierarchical block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner implemented through the Teko package in Trilinos, which effectively addresses the challenges posed by tightly coupled physics, including charge transport, porous flow, and species diffusion. The preconditioner leverages scalable subblock solvers, including smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid (SA-AMG) methods and domain-decomposition techniques, to achieve robust convergence and parallel scalability. Strong and weak scaling studies demonstrate the solver's ability to handle problem sizes up to 51.3 million degrees of freedom on 2048 processors, achieving near sub-second setup and solve times for the end-to-end electrochemical solve. These advancements significantly improve the computational efficiency and turnaround time of thermal battery simulations, paving the way for higher-resolution models and enabling the transition from 2D axisymmetric to full 3D simulations.",

Both settings involve uncertainty, partial observability, sensor noise, and ambiguous natural-language commands. The system exposes structured introspection of its planning and decision process, reacts to exogenous events via explicit event checks, and supports operator interventions that modify or redirect ongoing execution. Across both platforms, our proof-of-concept experiments reveal substantial fragility, including non-deterministic suboptimal behavior, instruction-following errors, and high sensitivity to prompt specification. At the same time, the architecture is flexible: transfer to a different robot and task domain largely required updating the system prompt (domain model, affordances, and action catalogue) and re-binding the same tool interface to the platform-specific skill API.",

However, traditional expert-driven approaches rely heavily on manual analysis of large volumes of interview transcripts, making them costly and prone to randomness, ambiguity, and limited reproducibility. This study proposes a new competency modeling process built on large language models (LLMs). Instead of merely automating isolated steps, we reconstruct the workflow by decomposing expert practices into structured computational components. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract behavioral and psychological descriptions from raw textual data and map them to predefined competency libraries through embedding-based similarity. We further introduce a learnable parameter that adaptively integrates different information sources, enabling the model to determine the relative importance of behavioral and psychological signals. To address the long-standing challenge of validation, we develop an offline evaluation procedure that allows systematic model selection without requiring additional large-scale data collection. Empirical results from a real-world implementation in a software outsourcing company demonstrate strong predictive validity, cross-library consistency, and structural robustness. Overall, our framework transforms competency modeling from a largely qualitative and expert-dependent practice into a transparent, data-driven, and evaluable analytical process.",

In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.",

AI tools monitor online sentiment to optimize directives and generate personalized content for users to post online. Cyborg propaganda thereby exploits a critical legal shield: by relying on verified citizens to ratify and disseminate messages, these campaigns operate in a regulatory gray zone, evading liability frameworks designed for automated botnets. We explore the collective action paradox of this technology: does it democratize power by 'unionizing' influence (pooling the reach of dispersed citizens to overcome the algorithmic invisibility of isolated voices), or does it reduce citizens to 'cognitive proxies' of a central directive?

We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods.

Despite their practicality, LLM judges remain prone to miscalibration and systematic biases. This paper proposes SCOPE (Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise Evaluation), a framework for selective pairwise judging with finite-sample statistical guarantees. Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $\\alpha$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $\\alpha = 0.10$, \\textsc{Scope} consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B. Compared to naÃ¯ve baselines, \\textsc{Scope} accepts up to $2.4\\times$ more judgments on MT-Bench with Qwen-7B under the same target risk constraint, demonstrating that BPE enables reliable and high-coverage LLM-based evaluation.",

APPO adaptively balances its strategies between exploiting user feedback and exploring new directions, yielding effective and efficient optimization.

We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data. Ablation studies further reveal that structural priors outperform brute-force scaling: a 280K-parameter model with proper ordering matches a 65M-parameter model without it.",

However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.",

The universal approximation theorem and foundational DRL results establish that all labor is in principle automatable. The critical question is not whether full automation will arrive, but who will control it. This paper introduces peaceful anarcho-accelerationism: a sociotechnical framework ensuring that full automation is decentralized, commons-governed, and oriented toward universal care. We propose the Liberation Stack, a layered architecture of energy, manufacturing, food, communication, knowledge, and governance commons built on open-source technologies. We show that this framework builds bridges with liberalism, socialism, environmentalism, feminism, cooperativism, and the hacker ethic. Empirical evidence from Linux, Wikipedia, Mondragon, Rojava, and http://guifi.net confirms that commons-based systems already operate at scale. We argue that full automation renders money obsolete and propose Universal Desired Resources (UDR), a post-monetary design principle where every person requests what they need from the robotic commons, constrained only by ecological sustainability. Drawing on the independence of phenomenal consciousness from computational intelligence, we establish that delegating labor to non-conscious machines is care at civilizational scale, and that moral policy can be studied through deep reinforcement learning. We conclude with a phased roadmap toward the care-centered society, including milestones, assumptions, and limitations.",

However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches.

Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation. Our agentic approach is free of modeling and can run on commodity hardware. When evaluated on incident logs reported in the literature, our agent achieves recovery up to 23% faster than those of frontier LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Due to sensor limitations, environments that off-road mobile robots operate in are often only partially observable. As the robots move throughout the environment and towards their goal, the optimal route is continuously revised as the sensors perceive new information. In traditional autonomous navigation architectures, a regional motion planner will consume the environment map and output a trajectory for the local motion planner to use as a reference. Due to the continuous revision of the regional plan guidance as a result of changing map information, the reference trajectories which are passed down to the local planner can differ significantly across sequential planning cycles. This rapidly changing guidance can result in unsafe navigation behavior, often requiring manual safety interventions during autonomous traversals in off-road environments. To remedy this problem, we propose Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (TSEASL), which is a regional planner arbitration architecture that considers updated and optimized versions of previously generated trajectories against the currently generated trajectory. When tested on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle as well as real map data collected from the Warthog, results indicate that when running TSEASL, the robot did not require manual interventions in the same locations where the robot was running the baseline planner. Additionally, higher levels of planner stability were recorded with TSEASL over the baseline. The paper concludes with a discussion of further improvements to TSEASL in order to make it more generalizable to various off-road autonomy scenarios.",

This study explores the intersection of human emotions, soft robotics, and art to establish and create new forms of human emotion-mediated soft robotic art. In this paper, we introduce two soft embodiments: a soft character and a soft flower as an art display that dynamically responds to brain signals based on alpha waves, reflecting different emotion levels. We present how human emotions can be measured as alpha waves based on brain/EEG signals, how we map the alpha waves to the dynamic movements of the two soft embodiments, and demonstrate our proposed concept using experiments.

Production deployments typically use a tiered static-dynamic design: a static cache of curated, offline vetted responses mined from logs, backed by a dynamic cache populated online. In practice, both tiers are commonly governed by a single embedding similarity threshold, which induces a hard tradeoff: conservative thresholds miss safe reuse opportunities, while aggressive thresholds risk serving semantically incorrect responses. We introduce \\textbf{Krites}, an asynchronous, LLM-judged caching policy that expands static coverage without changing serving decisions. On the critical path, Krites behaves exactly like a standard static threshold policy. When the nearest static neighbor of the prompt falls just below the static threshold, Krites asynchronously invokes an LLM judge to verify whether the static response is acceptable for the new prompt. Approved matches are promoted into the dynamic cache, allowing future repeats and paraphrases to reuse curated static answers and expanding static reach over time. In trace-driven simulations on conversational and search workloads, Krites increases the fraction of requests served with curated static answers (direct static hits plus verified promotions) by up to $\\textbf{3.9}$ times for conversational traffic and search-style queries relative to tuned baselines, with unchanged critical path latency.",

They typically anchor poses to the first frame, which leads to attention decay, scale drift, and extrapolation errors. We introduce LongStream, a novel gauge-decoupled streaming visual geometry model for metric-scale scene reconstruction across thousands of frames. Our approach is threefold. First, we discard the first-frame anchor and predict keyframe-relative poses. This reformulates long-range extrapolation into a constant-difficulty local task. Second, we introduce orthogonal scale learning. This method fully disentangles geometry from scale estimation to suppress drift. Finally, we solve Transformer cache issues such as attention-sink reliance and long-term KV-cache contamination. We propose cache-consistent training combined with periodic cache refresh. This approach suppresses attention degradation over ultra-long sequences and reduces the gap between training and inference. Experiments show LongStream achieves state-of-the-art performance. It delivers stable, metric-scale reconstruction over kilometer-scale sequences at 18 FPS. Project Page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/longstream/",

To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\\%$ and token usage by up to $93\\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.",

However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning. Across extensive real-world manipulation experiments, these two novel methods outperform prior embodied reasoning VLAs and VLM-based hierarchical baselines, including on challenging generalization and long-horizon tasks.\nWebsite: http://steerable-policies.github.io",

This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.",

Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively.",

Such late-stage fusion compresses rich genomic sequences into fixed representations, limiting the model's ability to reason over fine-grained, token-level genomic structure. In this work, we propose two new methods for DNA-language fusion, i.e., a semantic alignment method SeqCLIP and a vocabulary-level integration method OneVocab. SeqCLIP strengthens embedding-level alignment via sequence-level contrastive pre-training, and OneVocab directly integrates genomic $k$-mers into the language model's existing vocabulary. Comprehensive experiments on classification and reasoning tasks show that, while various alignment strategies improve embedding-level fusion, early vocabulary-level integration yields more expressive and effective representations for DNA-language modeling.",

In particular, static screening does not reveal whether (1) the same faulted line repeatedly triggers severe downstream overloads, or (2) a specific transformer emerges as vulnerable across many distinct fault scenarios. This paper introduces a real-time dynamic N-1 screening framework that addresses this gap by estimating, for each counterfactual single-phase transmission fault, the probability of transient overcurrent on critical grid elements. The output is an operator-facing dashboard that ranks (a) faulted lines whose outages most frequently lead to dangerous transformer overloads, and (b) transformers that consistently overload across top-risk scenarios, both of which are actionable indicators for real-time situational awareness. The approach models post-fault electromechanical dynamics using a linear stochastic formulation of the swing equations with short-lived, fault-localized uncertainty, and combines analytic transient evaluation with cross-entropy based importance sampling to efficiently estimate rare but high-impact events. All N-1 contingencies are evaluated in parallel with linear computational complexity. The framework is demonstrated on the IEEE 118-bus system, where it reveals latent high-risk lines and transformers that remain invisible under deterministic dynamic or static N-1 analysis. Results show orders-of-magnitude computational speedup relative to brute-force Monte Carlo, enabling practical deployment within real-time operational cycles.",

        "abstract": "We propose a training-free conditional sampling method for flow matching models based on importance sampling. Because a naÃ¯ve application of importance sampling suffers from weight degeneracy in high-dimensional settings, we modify and incorporate a resampling technique in sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) during intermediate stages of the generation process. To encourage generated samples to diverge along distinct trajectories, we derive a stochastic flow with adjustable noise strength to replace the deterministic flow at the intermediate stage. Our framework requires no additional training, while providing theoretical guarantees of asymptotic accuracy. Experimentally, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches on conditional sampling tasks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach in higher-dimensional, multimodal settings through text-to-image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ.",

        "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often struggle to suppress noise at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This paper addresses speech enhancement in scenarios dominated by harmonic noise and proposes a framework that integrates cyclostationarity-aware preprocessing with lightweight DNN-based denoising. A cyclic minimum power distortionless response (cMPDR) spectral beamformer is used as a preprocessing block. It exploits the spectral correlations of cyclostationary noise to suppress harmonic components prior to learning-based enhancement and does not require modifications to the DNN architecture. The proposed pipeline is evaluated in a single-channel setting using two DNN architectures: a simple and lightweight convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), and a state-of-the-art model, namely ultra-low complexity network (ULCNet). Experiments on synthetic data and real-world recordings dominated by rotating machinery noise demonstrate consistent improvements over end-to-end DNN baselines, particularly at low SNRs. Remarkably, a parameter-efficient CRNN with cMPDR preprocessing surpasses the performance of the larger ULCNet operating on raw or Wiener-filtered inputs. These results indicate that explicitly incorporating cyclostationarity as a signal prior is more effective than increasing model capacity alone for suppressing harmonic interference.",
