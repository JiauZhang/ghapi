        "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the paradigm of AI for Social Science (AI4SS), rigorously evaluating their capabilities in scholarly writing remains a major challenge. Existing benchmarks largely emphasize single-shot, monolithic generation and thus lack the fine-grained assessments required to reflect complex academic research workflows. To fill this gap, we introduce EduResearchBench, the first comprehensive evaluation platform dedicated to educational academic writing. EduResearchBench is built upon our Hierarchical Atomic Task Decomposition (HATD) framework, which decomposes an end-to-end research workflow into six specialized research modules (e.g., Quantitative Analysis, Qualitative Research, and Policy Research) spanning 24 fine-grained atomic tasks. This taxonomy enables an automated evaluation pipeline that mitigates a key limitation of holistic scoring, where aggregate scores often obscure specific capability bottlenecks, and instead provides fine-grained, diagnostic feedback on concrete deficiencies. Moreover, recognizing the high cognitive load inherent in scholarly writing, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that progressively builds competence from foundational skills to complex methodological reasoning and argumentation. Leveraging 55K raw academic samples, we curate 11K high-quality instruction pairs to train EduWrite, a specialized educational scholarly writing model. Experiments show that EduWrite (30B) substantially outperforms larger general-purpose models (72B) on multiple core metrics, demonstrating that in vertical domains, data quality density and hierarchically staged training curricula are more decisive than parameter scale.",

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) advance toward expert-level performance in engineering domains, reliable reasoning under user-specified constraints becomes critical. In circuit analysis, for example, a numerically correct solution is insufficient if it violates established methodological conventions such as mesh directionality or polarity assignments, errors that can propagate in safety-critical systems. Yet it remains unclear whether frontier models truly apply first-principles reasoning or rely on entrenched training priors that conflict with explicit instructions. We introduce CircuChain, a diagnostic benchmark designed to disentangle instruction compliance from physical reasoning competence in electrical circuit analysis. CircuChain consists of counterbalanced Control/Trap problem pairs across five canonical circuit topologies, augmented with systematic variations in sign conventions, current orientations, and polarity definitions. A multi-stage verification pipeline, combining symbolic solvers, SPICE simulation, and an LLM-based error taxonomy, enables fine-grained attribution of failures to convention errors, physics errors, arithmetic mistakes, or hallucinations. Across 100 tasks per model, we observe a consistent Compliance-Competence Divergence. The strongest model evaluated exhibits near-perfect physical reasoning but a high rate of convention violations when Trap conditions deliberately invert natural sign patterns. Conversely, weaker models display lower physical fidelity yet superior adherence to explicit instructions. These results suggest that increased model capability does not guarantee improved constraint alignment and highlight the need for new evaluation frameworks that stress instruction-following under mathematically rigid domains. CircuChain provides one such framework and offers actionable insights for both engineering education and AI alignment research.",

Prior work reveals that LLMs often operate in English centric representation spaces, making cross lingual interpretability a pressing concern. We introduce Indic-TunedLens, a novel interpretability framework specifically for Indian languages that learns shared affine transformations. Unlike the standard Logit Lens, which directly decodes intermediate activations, Indic-TunedLens adjusts hidden states for each target language, aligning them with the target output distributions to enable more faithful decoding of model representations. We evaluate our framework on 10 Indian languages using the MMLU benchmark and find that it significantly improves over SOTA interpretability methods, especially for morphologically rich, low resource languages. Our results provide crucial insights into the layer-wise semantic encoding of multilingual transformers. Our model is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/AnonymousAccountACL/IndicTunedLens.

However, current research efforts predominantly concentrate on analog semantic communication with simplified channel models. To bridge these gaps, we develop a robust vector quantized-enabled digital semantic communication (VQ-DSC-R) system built upon orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. Our work encompasses the framework design of VQ-DSC-R, followed by a comprehensive optimization study. Firstly, we design a Swin Transformer-based backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, integrated with VQ modules that map the features into a shared semantic quantized codebook (SQC) for efficient index transmission. Secondly, we propose a differentiable vector quantization with adaptive noise-variance (ANDVQ) scheme to mitigate quantization errors in SQC, which dynamically adjusts the quantization process using K-nearest neighbor statistics, while exponential moving average mechanism stabilizes SQC training. Thirdly, for robust index transmission over multipath fading channel and noise, we develop a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to refine channel state information, and design an attention-based module to dynamically adapt to channel noise. The entire VQ-DSC-R system is optimized via a three-stage training strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority of VQ-DSC-R over benchmark schemes, achieving high compression ratios and robust performance in practical scenarios.",

Building upon the foundations of AI agent architectures and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for multi-agent coordination, this paper introduces the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). ACP provides a standardized framework for Agent-to-Agent (AA) interaction, enabling heterogeneous agents to discover, negotiate, and execute collaborative workflows across disparate environments.

Although recent learning-based tracking methods enable agile and coordinated motions, they typically operate in the robot's local frame and neglect global pose feedback, leading to drift and instability during extended execution. In this work, we present CLOT, a real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation system that achieves closed-loop global motion tracking via high-frequency localization feedback. CLOT synchronizes operator and robot poses in a closed loop, enabling drift-free human-to-humanoid mimicry over long timehorizons. However, directly imposing global tracking rewards in reinforcement learning, often results in aggressive and brittle corrections. To address this, we propose a data-driven randomization strategy that decouples observation trajectories from reward evaluation, enabling smooth and stable global corrections. We further regularize the policy with an adversarial motion prior to suppress unnatural behaviors. To support CLOT, we collect 20 hours of carefully curated human motion data for training the humanoid teleoperation policy. We design a transformer-based policy and train it for over 1300 GPU hours. The policy is deployed on a full-sized humanoid with 31 DoF (excluding hands). Both simulation and real-world experiments verify high-dynamic motion, high-precision tracking, and strong robustness in sim-to-real humanoid teleoperation.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature search following the PRISMA guideline, identifying 86 articles that met our inclusion criteria. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs are transforming the fundamentals of HRI by reshaping how robots sense context, generate socially grounded interactions, and maintain continuous alignment with human needs in embodied settings; and (2) current research is largely exploratory, with different studies focusing on different facets of LLM-driven HRI, resulting in wide-ranging choices of experimental setups, study methods, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify key design considerations and challenges, offering a coherent overview and guidelines for future research at the intersection of LLMs and HRI.",

However, their classical formulation relies on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), whose fixed activation functions and global approximation biases limit performance in problems with oscillatory behavior, multiscale dynamics, or sharp gradients. In parallel, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been introduced as a functionally adaptive architecture based on learnable univariate transformations along each edge, providing richer local approximations and improved expressivity. This work presents a systematic and controlled comparison between standard MLP-based PINNs and their KAN-based counterparts, Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), using identical physics-informed formulations and matched parameter budgets to isolate the architectural effect. Both models are evaluated across a representative collection of ODEs and PDEs, including cases with known analytical solutions that allow direct assessment of gradient reconstruction accuracy. The results show that PIKANs consistently achieve more accurate solutions, converge in fewer iterations, and yield superior gradient estimates, highlighting their advantage for physics-informed learning. These findings underline the potential of KAN-based architectures as a next-generation approach for scientific machine learning and provide rigorous evidence to guide model selection in differential equation solving.",

To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance. However, existing methods often suffer from significant safety violations or require a high sample complexity to generate near-optimal policies. We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\\varepsilon$-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{SAH^3}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$ learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs. For strict feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy with zero violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{SAH^5}{\\varepsilon^2\\zeta^2}\\right)$ learning episodes, where $\\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant characterizing the size of the feasible region. This result matches the lower bound for learning CMDPs with access to a generative model.\nOur results demonstrate that learning CMDPs in an online setting is as easy as learning with a generative model and is no more challenging than learning unconstrained MDPs when small violations are allowed.",

In this paper, we present S-PRESSO, a 48kHz sound effect compression model that produces both continuous and discrete embeddings at ultra-low bitrates, down to 0.096 kbps, via offline quantization. Our model relies on a pretrained latent diffusion model to decode compressed audio embeddings learned by a latent encoder.

To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass.

Therefore, a new CGRA DeBERTa, a concept guided residual domain augmentation transformer framework, is proposed that enhances theological QA over Hadith corpora. The CGRA DeBERTa builds on a customized DeBERTa transformer backbone with lightweight LoRA based adaptations and a residual concept aware gating mechanism. The customized DeBERTa embedding block learns global and positional context, while Concept Guided Residual Blocks incorporate theological priors from a curated Islamic Concept Dictionary of 12 core terms. Moreover, the Concept Gating Mechanism selectively amplifies semantically critical tokens via importance weighted attention, applying differential scaling from 1.04 to 3.00. This design preserves contextual integrity, strengthens domain-specific semantic representations, and enables accurate, efficient span extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper reports the results of training CGRA using a specially constructed dataset of 42591 QA pairs from the text of Sahih alBukhari and Sahih Muslim. While BERT achieved an EM score of 75.87 and DeBERTa one of 89.77, our model scored 97.85 and thus surpassed them by 8.08 on an absolute scale, all while adding approximately 8 inference overhead due to parameter efficient gating. The qualitative evaluation noted better extraction and discrimination and theological precision. This study presents Hadith QA systems that are efficient, interpretable, and accurate and that scale provide educational materials with necessary theological nuance.",

        "abstract": "Language models are increasingly used to reason over content they were not trained on, such as new documents, evolving knowledge, and user-specific data. A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time.

Prior self-supervised meth- ods either impute before learning, represent missingness through a dedicated input signal, or optimize solely for imputation, reducing their capacity to efficiently learn representations that support clinical downstream tasks. We propose the Augmented-Intrinsic Dual-Masked Autoencoder (AID-MAE), which learns directly from incomplete time series by applying an intrinsic missing mask to represent naturally missing values and an augmented mask that hides a subset of observed values for reconstruction during training. AID-MAE processes only the unmasked subset of tokens and consistently outperforms strong baselines, including XGBoost and DuETT, across multiple clinical tasks on two datasets.

Despite the increasing adoption of robotic platforms in agriculture, the lack of standardized, reproducible benchmarks impedes fair comparisons and systematic evaluations of control strategies under realistic operating conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating mobile robot controllers in greenhouse environments. The proposed framework integrates an accurate three dimensional model of the environment, a physics based simulator, and a hierarchical control architecture comprising low, mid, and high level control layers. Three benchmark categories are defined to enable modular assessment, ranging from actuator level control to full autonomous navigation. Additionally, three disturbance scenarios payload variation, terrain type, and slope are explicitly modeled to replicate real world agricultural conditions. To ensure objective and reproducible evaluation, standardized performance metrics are introduced, including the Squared Absolute Error (SAE), the Squared Control Input (SCI), and composite performance indices. Statistical analysis based on repeated trials is employed to mitigate the influence of sensor noise and environmental variability. The framework is further enhanced by a plugin based architecture that facilitates seamless integration of user defined controllers and planners. The proposed benchmark provides a robust and extensible tool for the quantitative comparison of classical, predictive, and planning based control strategies in realistic conditions, bridging the gap between simulation based analysis and real world agroindustrial applications.",

We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning.",

        "abstract": "Camera virtualization -- an emerging solution to novel view synthesis -- holds transformative potential for visual entertainment, live performances, and sports broadcasting by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using images from a limited set of calibrated multiple static physical cameras. Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...",

To investigate this effect, we build a controlled synthetic retrieval task and find that a transformer trained only on text achieves perfect in-distribution accuracy but fails to generalize out of distribution, while subsequent training on an image-tokenized version of the same task nearly doubles text-only OOD performance. Mechanistic interpretability reveals that visual training changes the model's internal binding strategy: text-only training encourages positional shortcuts, whereas image-based training disrupts them through spatial translation invariance, forcing the model to adopt a more robust symbolic binding mechanism that persists even after text-only examples are reintroduced. We further characterize how binding strategies vary across training regimes, visual encoders, and initializations, and show that analogous shifts occur during pretrained LLM-to-VLM transitions. Our findings suggest that cross-modal training can enhance reasoning and generalization even for tasks grounded in a single modality.",

In practical systems, the channel Gram matrix can be estimated from received symbols and it provides realization-level information about channel subspace structure. The proposed method integrates a pre-trained angular-domain diffusion prior with two complementary guidance mechanisms: a novel Gram-matrix guidance term that enforces second-order consistency during the reverse diffusion process, and likelihood guidance from pilot observations. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-matched initialization and adaptive guidance scaling ensure stability and low inference latency. Simulations on 3GPP and QuaDRiGa channel models demonstrate consistent normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) improvements over deterministic diffusion baselines, achieving 4 to 6 dB SNR gains at an NMSE of 0.1 over the baseline in Fest et al. (2024). The framework exhibits graceful degradation under coherence-time constraints, smoothly reverting to likelihood-guided diffusion when data-based Gram estimates become unreliable.",

Can LLM agents improve their performance in environments with opaque tools by interacting and subsequently improving documentation? To study this, we create OpaqueToolsBench, a benchmark consisting of three distinct task-oriented environments: general function calling, interactive chess playing, and long-trajectory agentic search. Each environment provides underspecified tools that models must learn to use effectively to complete the task. Results on OpaqueToolsBench suggest existing methods for automatically documenting tools are expensive and unreliable when tools are opaque. To address this, we propose a simple framework, ToolObserver, that iteratively refines tool documentation by observing execution feedback from tool-calling trajectories. Our approach outperforms existing methods on OpaqueToolsBench across datasets, even in relatively hard settings. Furthermore, for test-time tool exploration settings, our method is also efficient, consuming 3.5-7.5x fewer total tokens than the best baseline.",

Colosseum tests each LLM for collusion under different objectives, persuasion tactics, and network topologies. Through our audit, we show that most out-of-the-box models exhibited a propensity to collude when a secret communication channel was artificially formed.

We propose COMPOT (Calibration-Optimized Matrix Procrustes Orthogonalization for Transformers), a training-free compression framework that uses a small calibration dataset to estimate a sparse weight factorization. COMPOT employs orthogonal dictionaries that enable closed-form Procrustes updates for the dictionary and analytical single-step sparse coding for the coefficients, eliminating iterative optimization. To handle heterogeneous layer sensitivity under a global compression budget, COMPOT further introduces a one-shot dynamic allocation strategy that adaptively redistributes layer-wise compression rates. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks show that COMPOT consistently delivers a superior quality-compression trade-off over strong low-rank and sparse baselines, while remaining fully compatible with post-training quantization for extreme compression.

Analytical grasp synthesis can be used to scale data collection, but necessary simplifying assumptions often yield physically infeasible grasps that need to be filtered in high-fidelity simulators, significantly reducing the total number of grasps and their diversity.\nWe propose a scalable generate-and-refine pipeline for synthesizing large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps. Instead of using high-fidelity simulators solely for verification and filtering, we leverage them as an optimization stage that continuously improves grasp quality without discarding precomputed candidates. More specifically, we initialize an evolutionary search with a seed set of analytically generated, potentially suboptimal grasps. We then refine these proposals directly in a high-fidelity simulator (Isaac Sim) using an asynchronous, gradient-free evolutionary algorithm, improving stability while maintaining diversity. In addition, this refinement stage can be guided toward human preferences and/or domain-specific quality metrics without requiring a differentiable objective. We further distill the refined grasp distribution into a diffusion model for robust real-world deployment, and highlight the role of diversity for both effective training and during deployment. Experiments on a newly introduced Handles dataset and a DexGraspNet subset demonstrate that our approach achieves over 120 distinct stable grasps per object (a 1.7-6x improvement over unrefined analytical methods) while outperforming diffusion-based alternatives by 46-60\\% in unique grasp coverage.",

To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes.

This study introduces a multi-agent home energy management assistant (HEMA), built on LangChain and LangGraph, designed to adaptively and intelligently handle real-world use cases of HEMS with full system customization capability. It carefully classifies user queries via a self-consistency classifier, requests three specialized agents (Analysis, Knowledge, and Control) to prepare accurate, adaptive responses using purpose-built analysis and control tools and retrieval augmented generation under the reasoning and acting mechanism. HEMA was rigorously assessed using two different experimental analyses via an LLM-as-user approach: (1) analytical and informative capabilities using combinatorial test cases of various personas and differing scenarios against three alternative system configurations relying on vanilla LLM and (2) control capabilities using various control scenarios. Out of 295 test cases, HEMA acquired a 91.9% goal achievement rate, successfully fulfilling user requests while providing high levels of factual accuracy, action correctness, interaction quality, and system efficiency, especially when compared to alternative system configurations.

        "abstract": "Reward models are central to large language model (LLM) post-training. However, past work has shown that they can reward spurious or undesirable attributes such as length, format, hallucinations, and sycophancy. In this work, we introduce and study the research problem of automatically finding reward model biases in natural language. We offer a simple approach of using an LLM to iteratively propose and refine candidate biases. Our method can recover known biases and surface novel ones: for example, we found that Skywork-V2-8B, a leading open-weight reward model, often mistakenly favors responses with redundant spacing and responses with hallucinated content. In addition, we show evidence that evolutionary iteration outperforms flat best-of-N search, and we validate the recall of our pipeline using synthetically injected biases. We hope our work contributes to further research on improving RMs through automated interpretability methods.",

Recent CLIP-style models such as DrugCLIP enable scalable virtual screening by embedding pockets and ligands into a shared space. However, our analyses indicate that such representations can be insensitive to fine-grained binding interactions and may rely on shortcut correlations in training data, limiting their ability to rank ligands by true binding compatibility. To address these issues, we propose BindCLIP, a unified contrastive-generative representation learning framework for virtual screening. BindCLIP jointly trains pocket and ligand encoders using CLIP-style contrastive learning together with a pocket-conditioned diffusion objective for binding pose generation, so that pose-level supervision directly shapes the retrieval embedding space toward interaction-relevant features. To further mitigate shortcut reliance, we introduce hard-negative augmentation and a ligand-ligand anchoring regularizer that prevents representation collapse. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. BindCLIP achieves substantial gains on challenging out-of-distribution virtual screening and improves ligand-analogue ranking on the FEP+ benchmark. Together, these results indicate that integrating generative, pose-level supervision with contrastive learning yields more interaction-aware embeddings and improves generalization in realistic screening settings, bringing virtual screening closer to real-world applicability.",

We address this gap by evaluating a prototype that fuses robot-mounted depth sensing and YOLO detection with a vision language model (VLM) capable of verbalizing metrically-grounded distances of detected objects (e.g., the chair is 3.02 meters away). In a mixed-reality toxic-smoke scenario, participants estimated distances to a victim and an exit window under three conditions: video-only, depth-agnostic VLM, and depth-augmented VLM. Depth-augmentation improved objective accuracy and stability, e.g., the victim and window distance estimation error dropped, while raising situational awareness without increasing workload. Conversely, depth- agnostic assistance increased workload and slightly worsened accuracy. We contribute to human SA augmentation by demonstrating that metrically grounded, object-centric verbal information supports spatial reasoning in EFR and improves decision-relevant judgments under time pressure.",

However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods.",

These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.",

We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation.

However, reliably moving within the slippery, viscoelastic environment of the colon remains a significant challenge. We present OSCAR, an ovipositor-inspired self-propelling capsule robot that translates the transport strategy of parasitic wasps into a propulsion mechanism for colonoscopy. OSCAR mechanically encodes the ovipositor-inspired motion pattern through a spring-loaded cam system that drives twelve circumferential sliders in a coordinated, phase-shifted sequence. By tuning the motion profile to maximize the retract phase relative to the advance phase, the capsule creates a controlled friction anisotropy at the interface that generates net forward thrust. We developed an analytical model incorporating a Kelvin-Voigt formulation to capture the viscoelastic stick--slip interactions between the sliders and the tissue, linking the asymmetry between advance and retract phase durations to mean thrust, and slider-reversal synchronization to thrust stability. Comprehensive force characterization experiments in ex-vivo porcine colon revealed a mean steady-state traction force of 0.85 N, closely matching the model. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that thrust generation is speed-independent and scales linearly with the phase asymmetry, in agreement with theoretical predictions, underscoring the capsule's predictable performance and scalability. In locomotion validation experiments, OSCAR demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average speed of 3.08 mm/s, a velocity sufficient to match the cecal intubation times of conventional colonoscopy. By coupling phase-encoded friction anisotropy with a predictive model, OSCAR delivers controllable thrust generation at low normal loads, enabling safer and more robust self-propelling locomotion for robotic capsule colonoscopy.",

The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.",

Extensive LLM pre-training experiments show that Magma is a simple drop-in replacement for adaptive optimizers with consistent gains and negligible computational overhead.

Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities.

Existing interpretability methods often highlight tokens or spans correlated with an answer, but they rarely reveal where the model makes consequential reasoning turns, which earlier context causally triggers those turns, or whether the highlighted text actually steers the reasoning process. We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score. We also compute turning-angle curvature changes on raw logits as a complementary diagnostic and introduce curvature signatures to summarize shared intervention-response geometry. Empirically, directional influence is sharply concentrated across four reasoning models (per-example |DRTC| shares yield Gini 0.50 to 0.58 and top-5 percent mass 0.23 to 0.28), and learned pivots induce stronger intervention magnitudes than matched random spans. In a scaling study on 500 MATH problems with R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, learned spans outperform matched random spans (median delta = 0.409, 355 of 500 positive; sign test p = 2.3e-21).

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by undergraduate students as on-demand tutors, yet their reliability on circuit- and diagram-based digital logic problems remains unclear. We present a human- AI study evaluating three widely used LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and Claude) on 10 undergraduate-level digital logic questions spanning non-standard counters, JK-based state transitions, timing diagrams, frequency division, and finite-state machines. Twenty-four students performed pairwise model comparisons, providing per-question judgments on (i) preferred model, (ii) perceived correctness, (iii) consistency, (iv) verbosity, and (v) confidence, along with global ratings of overall model quality, satisfaction across multiple dimensions (e.g., accuracy and clarity), and perceived mental effort required to verify answers. To benchmark technical validity, we applied an independent judge-based evaluation against official solutions for all ten questions, using strict correctness criteria. Results reveal a consistent gap between perceived helpfulness and formal correctness: for the most sequentially demanding problems (Q1- Q7), none of the evaluated LLMs matched the official answers, despite producing confident, well-structured explanations that students often rated favorably. Error analysis indicates that models frequently default to canonical textbook templates (e.g., standard ripple counters) and struggle to translate circuit structure into exact state evolution and timing behavior. These findings suggest that, without verification scaffolds, LLMs may be unreliable for core digital logic topics and can inadvertently reinforce misconceptions in undergraduate instruction.",

Existing interpretation methods typically rely on pre-defined rubrics, risking the omission of \"unknown unknowns\", or fail to identify objectives that comprehensively cover and are causal to the model behavior. To address these limitations, we introduce Obj-Disco, a framework that automatically decomposes an alignment reward signal into a sparse, weighted combination of human-interpretable natural language objectives. Our approach utilizes an iterative greedy algorithm to analyze behavioral changes across training checkpoints, identifying and validating candidate objectives that best explain the residual reward signal. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, model sizes, and alignment algorithms demonstrate the framework's robustness. Experiments with popular open-source reward models show that the framework consistently captures > 90% of reward behavior, a finding further corroborated by human evaluation. Additionally, a case study on alignment with an open-source reward model reveals that Obj-Disco can successfully identify latent misaligned incentives that emerge alongside intended behaviors. Our work provides a crucial tool for uncovering the implicit objectives in LLM alignment, paving the way for more transparent and safer AI development.",

However, due to differences in physical characteristics between demonstrators and robots, this approach faces two limitations: i) the demonstration data do not include robot actions, and ii) the demonstrated motions may be infeasible for robots. These limitations make policy learning difficult. To address them, we propose Feasibility-Aware Behavior Cloning from Observation (FABCO). FABCO integrates behavior cloning from observation, which complements robot actions using robot dynamics models, with feasibility estimation. In feasibility estimation, the demonstrated motions are evaluated using a robot-dynamics model, learned from the robot's execution data, to assess reproducibility under the robot's dynamics. The estimated feasibility is used for multimodal feedback and feasibility-aware policy learning to improve the demonstrator's motions and learn robust policies. Multimodal feedback provides feasibility through the demonstrator's visual and haptic senses to promote feasible demonstrated motions. Feasibility-aware policy learning reduces the influence of demonstrated motions that are infeasible for robots, enabling the learning of policies that robots can execute stably. We conducted experiments with 15 participants on two tasks and confirmed that FABCO improves imitation learning performance by more than 3.2 times compared to the case without feasibility feedback.",

Inspired by structural principles of the cerebellum, we propose a biologically grounded RL architecture that incorporate large expansion, sparse connectivity, sparse activation, and dendritic-level modulation. Experiments on noisy, high-dimensional RL benchmarks show that both the cerebellar architecture and dendritic modulation consistently improve sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization compared to conventional designs. Sensitivity analysis of architectural parameters suggests that cerebellum-inspired structures can offer optimized performance for RL with constrained model parameters.

Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.",

We systematically tackle various challenges posed by absence of training data for Tulu by combining explicit grammar documentation, negative constraints to suppress high-probability tokens from related languages, romanization standardization, and quality-controlled synthetic data generation via self-play. Evaluated on a manually curated held-out set across three LLMs (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 70B) and validated by native speakers, our approach reduces vocabulary contamination from 80% to 5% while achieving 85% grammatical accuracy.

While latent state transfer offers a high-bandwidth alternative, existing approaches either assume homogeneous sender-receiver architectures or rely on pair-specific learned translators, limiting scalability and modularity across diverse model families with disjoint manifolds. In this work, we propose the Vision Wormhole, a novel framework that repurposes the visual interface of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable model-agnostic, text-free communication. By introducing a Universal Visual Codec, we map heterogeneous reasoning traces into a shared continuous latent space and inject them directly into the receiver's visual pathway, effectively treating the vision encoder as a universal port for inter-agent telepathy. Our framework adopts a hub-and-spoke topology to reduce pairwise alignment complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) and leverages a label-free, teacher-student distillation objective to align the high-speed visual channel with the robust reasoning patterns of the text pathway. Extensive experiments across heterogeneous model families (e.g., Qwen-VL, Gemma) demonstrate that the Vision Wormhole reduces end-to-end wall-clock time in controlled comparisons while maintaining reasoning fidelity comparable to standard text-based MAS.

To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain.

Therefore, verifying whether the generated assertions effectively cover the functional specifications and designing feedback mechanisms based on this coverage remain significant hurdles. To address these limitations, this paper introduces CoverAssert, a novel iterative framework for optimizing SVA generation with LLMs. The core contribution is a lightweight mechanism for matching generated assertions with specific functional descriptions in the specifications. CoverAssert achieves this by clustering the joint representations of semantic features of LLM-generated assertions and structural features extracted from abstract syntax trees (ASTs) about signals related to assertions, and then mapping them back to the specifications to analyze functional coverage quality. Leveraging this capability, CoverAssert constructs a feedback loop based on functional coverage to guide LLMs in prioritizing uncovered functional points, thereby iteratively improving assertion quality. Experimental evaluations on four open-source designs demonstrate that integrating CoverAssert with state-of-the-art generators, AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion, achieves average improvements of 9.57 % in branch coverage, 9.64 % in statement coverage, and 15.69 % in toggle coverage.",

First, we view the SchrÃ¶dinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator.",

Consequently, the fundamental question of \\textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \\textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks.

        "abstract": "A navigable agent needs to understand both high-level semantic instructions and precise spatial perceptions. Building navigation agents centered on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates a promising solution due to their powerful generalization ability. However, the current tightly coupled design dramatically limits system performance. In this work, we propose a decoupled design that separates low-level spatial state estimation from high-level semantic planning. Unlike previous methods that rely on predefined, oversimplified textual maps, we introduce an interactive metric world representation that maintains rich and consistent information, allowing MLLMs to interact with and reason on it for decision-making. Furthermore, counterfactual reasoning is introduced to further elicit MLLMs' capacity, while the metric world representation ensures the physical validity of the produced actions. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments. Our method establishes a new zero-shot state-of-the-art, achieving 48.8\\% Success Rate (SR) in R2R-CE and 42.2\\% in RxR-CE benchmarks. Furthermore, to validate the versatility of our metric representation, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across diverse embodiments, including a wheeled TurtleBot 4 and a custom-built aerial drone. These real-world deployments verify that our decoupled framework serves as a robust, domain-invariant interface for embodied Vision-and-Language navigation.",

Standard approaches typically treat signal enhancement and classification as separate, sequential stages: first enhancing the signal and then applying a classifier. This approach fails to leverage the semantic information in the classifier's output during denoising. In this work, we propose a general, domain-agnostic framework that integrates two interacting diffusion models: one operating on the input signal and the other on the classifier's output logits, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning of the classifier. This coupled formulation enables mutual guidance, where the enhancing signal refines the class estimation and, conversely, the evolving class logits guide the signal reconstruction towards discriminative regions of the manifold. We introduce three strategies to effectively model the joint distribution of the input and the logit. We evaluated our joint enhancement method for image classification and automatic speech recognition. The proposed framework surpasses traditional sequential enhancement baselines, delivering robust and flexible improvements in classification accuracy under diverse noise conditions.",

In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, these problems are often addressed by incorporating intrinsic drives that encourage prosocial or fair behavior. However, most existing methods assume that agents face identical incentives in the dilemma and require continuous access to global information about other agents to assess fairness. In this work, we introduce asymmetric variants of well-known SSD environments and examine how natural differences between agents influence cooperation dynamics. Our findings reveal that existing fairness-based methods struggle to adapt under asymmetric conditions by enforcing raw equality that wrongfully incentivize defection. To address this, we propose three modifications: (i) redefining fairness by accounting for agents' reward ranges, (ii) introducing an agent-based weighting mechanism to better handle inherent asymmetries, and (iii) localizing social feedback to make the methods effective under partial observability without requiring global information sharing. Experimental results show that in asymmetric scenarios, our method fosters faster emergence of cooperative policies compared to existing approaches, without sacrificing scalability or practicality.",

Prior work extracted more than 350K mentions of leisure time activities and organizational memberships from these interviews, yielding 71K unique activity and organization names -- far too many to analyze directly.\nWe develop a categorization framework that captures key aspects of participation (the kind of activity/organization, how social it typically is, how regularly it happens, and how physically demanding it is). We annotate a gold-standard set to allow for a reliable evaluation, and then test whether large language models can apply the same schema at scale.

Incentivizing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs is essential to overcoming this hurdle. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy to address this need. However, most existing approaches overlook the heterogeneous difficulty and granularity inherent in test cases, leading to an imbalanced distribution of reward signals and consequently biased gradient updates during training. To address this, we propose Test-driven and cApability-adaptive cuRriculum reinfOrcement fine-Tuning (TAROT). TAROT systematically constructs, for each problem, a four-tier test suite (basic, intermediate, complex, edge), providing a controlled difficulty landscape for curriculum design and evaluation. Crucially, TAROT decouples curriculum progression from raw reward scores, enabling capability-conditioned evaluation and principled selection from a portfolio of curriculum policies rather than incidental test-case difficulty composition. This design fosters stable optimization and more efficient competency acquisition. Extensive experimental results reveal that the optimal curriculum for RFT in code generation is closely tied to a model's inherent capability, with less capable models achieving greater gains with an easy-to-hard progression, whereas more competent models excel under a hard-first curriculum. TAROT provides a reproducible method that adaptively tailors curriculum design to a model's capability, thereby consistently improving the functional correctness and robustness of the generated code.

These agents filter, prioritize, and synthesize information retrieved from the platforms' back-end databases or via web search. In these scenarios, LLM agents govern the information users receive, by drawing users' attention to particular instances of retrieved information at the expense of others. While much prior work has focused on biases in the information LLMs themselves generate, less attention has been paid to the factors that influence what information LLMs select and present to users. We hypothesize that when information is attributed to specific sources (e.g., particular publishers, journals, or platforms), current LLMs exhibit systematic latent source preferences- that is, they prioritize information from some sources over others. Through controlled experiments on twelve LLMs from six model providers, spanning both synthetic and real-world tasks, we find that several models consistently exhibit strong and predictable source preferences. These preferences are sensitive to contextual framing, can outweigh the influence of content itself, and persist despite explicit prompting to avoid them. They also help explain phenomena such as the observed left-leaning skew in news recommendations in prior work. Our findings advocate for deeper investigation into the origins of these preferences, as well as for mechanisms that provide users with transparency and control over the biases guiding LLM-powered agents.",

However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization. Finally, purely text-based models consistently outperform those utilizing image-based inputs, including a recently proposed approach relying on latent space reasoning.",

In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability.

We realize both MLP and attention blocks as explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows, ensuring inherent stability without sacrificing expressivity. We prove a universal approximation theorem for this class within a Lipschitz-constrained function space.

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, reliable methods for detecting AI-generated text are critical for mitigating potential risks. We introduce DependencyAI, a simple and interpretable approach for detecting AI-generated text using only the labels of linguistic dependency relations. Our method achieves competitive performance across monolingual, multi-generator, and multilingual settings. To increase interpretability, we analyze feature importance to reveal syntactic structures that distinguish AI-generated from human-written text. We also observe a systematic overprediction of certain models on unseen domains, suggesting that generator-specific writing styles may affect cross-domain generalization. Overall, our results demonstrate that dependency relations alone provide a robust signal for AI-generated text detection, establishing DependencyAI as a strong linguistically grounded, interpretable, and non-neural network baseline.",

However, such training risks models learning to obfuscate their deception to evade the detector. Prior work has studied obfuscation only in artificial settings where models were directly rewarded for harmful output. We construct a realistic coding environment where reward hacking via hardcoding test cases naturally occurs, and show that obfuscation emerges in this setting. We introduce a taxonomy of possible outcomes when training against a deception detector. The model either remains honest, or becomes deceptive via two possible obfuscation strategies. (i) Obfuscated activations: the model outputs deceptive text while modifying its internal representations to no longer trigger the detector. (ii) Obfuscated policy: the model outputs deceptive text that evades the detector, typically by including a justification for the reward hack. Empirically, obfuscated activations arise from representation drift during RL, with or without a detector penalty. The probe penalty only incentivizes obfuscated policies; we theoretically show this is expected for policy gradient methods. Sufficiently high KL regularization and detector penalty can yield honest policies, establishing white-box deception detectors as viable training signals for tasks prone to reward hacking.",

A semantic filtering framework was proposed for category-aware transient removal using vision-language models. CLIP similarity scores between rendered views and distractor text prompts were accumulated per-Gaussian across training iterations. Gaussians exceeding a calibrated threshold underwent opacity regularization and periodic pruning. Unlike motion-based approaches, semantic classification resolved parallax ambiguity by identifying object categories independently of motion patterns. Experiments on the RobustNeRF benchmark demonstrated consistent improvement in reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS across four sequences, while maintaining minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering performance. Threshold calibration and comparisons with baselines validated semantic guidance as a practical strategy for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories.",

However, training high-quality MoEs from scratch is prohibitively expensive. A promising alternative is to convert pretrained dense models into sparse MoEs. Existing dense-to-MoE methods fall into two categories: \\textbf{dynamic structural pruning} that converts dense models into MoE architectures with moderate sparsity to balance performance and inference efficiency, and \\textbf{downcycling} approaches that use pretrained dense models to initialize highly sparse MoE architectures. However, existing methods break the intrinsic activation patterns within dense models, leading to suboptimal expert construction. In this work, we argue that the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) mechanism provides a natural blueprint for dense-to-MoE conversion. We show that the fine-grained neural-wise activation patterns of GLU reveal a coarse-grained structure, uncovering an inherent MoE architecture composed of consistently activated universal neurons and dynamically activated specialized neurons. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce ExpertWeaver, a training-free framework that partitions neurons according to their activation patterns and constructs shared experts and specialized routed experts with layer-adaptive configurations. Our experiments demonstrate that ExpertWeaver significantly outperforms existing methods, both as a training-free dynamic structural pruning technique and as a downcycling strategy for superior MoE initialization.",

However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.\nBoth social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.\nThis thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations.",

To this end, we utilize a policy evaluation-based similarity measure that identifies suitable policies for initialization from a library. We demonstrate that this measure correlates with the reduction in environment interactions needed to reach target performance and is therefore suited for initialization.

To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.",

This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments.",

Streaming Flow Policies (SFPs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating robot trajectories by integrating learned velocity fields directly in action space, enabling smooth and reactive control. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for adapting trajectories post-training to enforce safety and task-specific constraints. We propose Constraint-Aware Streaming Flow (CASF), a framework that augments streaming flow policies with constraint-dependent metrics that reshape the learned velocity field during execution. CASF models each constraint, defined in either the robot's workspace or configuration space, as a differentiable distance function that is converted into a local metric and pulled back into the robot's control space. Far from restricted regions, the resulting metric reduces to the identity; near constraint boundaries, it smoothly attenuates or redirects motion, effectively deforming the underlying flow to maintain safety. This allows trajectories to be adapted in real time, ensuring that robot actions respect joint limits, avoid collisions, and remain within feasible workspaces, while preserving the multi-modal and reactive properties of streaming flow policies. We demonstrate CASF in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, showing that it produces constraint-satisfying trajectories that remain smooth, feasible, and dynamically consistent, outperforming standard post-hoc projection baselines.",

We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \\emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \\emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint. To establish causality, we perform targeted Image$\\rightarrow$Question attention knockouts and show that disrupting the primary transduction pathway induces predictable increases in trapped visual-unique information, compensatory synergy, and total information cost -- effects that are strongest in vision-dependent tasks and weakest in high-redundancy tasks.

We employ three annotation dimensions, inferred through LLM prompting and averaging, to capture complementary aspects of discursive conflict (such as stance: agreement vs disagreement; tone: attacking vs respectful; and emotional versus factual framing) and use data from a threaded online forum to examine how these dimensions respond to temporal, conversational, and arborescent structural features of discussions. We show that, as suggested by the literature, longer delays between successive posts in a thread are associated with replies that are, on average, more respectful, whereas longer delays relative to the parent post are associated with slightly less disagreement but more emotional (less factual) language. Second, we characterize alignment with the local conversational environment and find strong convergence both toward the average stance, tone and emotional framing of older sibling posts replying to the same parent and toward those of the parent post itself, with parent post effects generally stronger than sibling effects. We further show that early branch-level responses condition these alignment dynamics, such that parent-child stance alignment is amplified or attenuated depending on whether a branch is initiated in agreement or disagreement with the discussion's root message. These influences are largely additive for civility-related dimensions (attacking vs respectful, disagree vs agree), whereas for emotional versus factual framing there is a significant interaction: alignment with the parent's emotionality is amplified when older siblings are similarly aligned.",

To alleviate this conflict, we propose an optimization-based unsupervised learning approach based on the wireless transformer (WiT) architecture that learns from channel state information (CSI) features. We reformulate the trade-off by combining the sum rate and fairness objectives through a Lagrangian multiplier, which is updated automatically via a dual-ascent algorithm. This mechanism allows for a controllable fairness constraint while simultaneously maximizing the sum rate, effectively realizing a trace on the Pareto front between two conflicting objectives. Our findings show that the proposed approach offers a flexible solution for managing the trade-off optimization under prescribed fairness.",

In practice, they often experience late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. We derive that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. Building on this result, we prove that training instability is driven by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0.01\\%, which we term \\emph{spurious tokens}. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates. Motivated by this observation, we propose Spurious-Token-Aware Policy Optimization (STAPO) for large-scale model refining, which selectively masks such updates and renormalizes the loss over valid tokens. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Qwen 1.7B, 8B, and 14B base models, STAPO consistently demonstrates superior entropy stability and achieves an average performance improvement of 7.13\\% over GRPO, 20-Entropy and JustRL.",

However, conventional BP writing remains a rigid, linear process that often fails to reflect the dynamic and recursive nature of entrepreneurial ideation. This mismatch is particularly challenging for novice entrepreneurial students, who struggle with the substantial cognitive demands of developing and refining ideas. While reflection and meta-reflection are critical strategies for fostering divergent and convergent thinking, existing writing tools rarely scaffold these higher-order processes. To address this gap, we present the Meflex System, a large language model (LLM)-based writing tool that integrates BP writing scaffolding with a nonlinear idea canvas to support iterative ideation through reflection and meta-reflection. We report findings from an exploratory user study with 30 participants that examined the system's usability and cognitive impact. Results show that Meflex effectively scaffolds BP writing, promotes divergent thinking through LLM-supported reflection, and enhances meta-reflective awareness while reducing cognitive load during complex idea development. These findings highlight the potential of non-linear LLM-based writing tools to foster deeper and coherent entrepreneurial thinking.",

However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.",

        "abstract": "Inverse design problems are common in engineering and materials science. The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that the material density of generated samples can be minimized simultaneously by using a multi-objective loss function.",

This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker.\nWe present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents.",

We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control.",

To address this gap, we propose CAMEL, the first ELM that is capable of inference over longer signal durations which enables its forecasting capability.

        "abstract": "Northrop Frye's theory of four fundamental narrative genres (comedy, romance, tragedy, satire) has profoundly influenced literary criticism, yet computational approaches to his framework have focused primarily on narrative patterns rather than character functions. In this paper, we present a new character function framework that complements pattern-based analysis by examining how archetypal roles manifest differently across Frye's genres. Drawing on Jungian archetype theory, we derive four universal character functions (protagonist, mentor, antagonist, companion) by mapping them to Jung's psychic structure components. These functions are then specialized into sixteen genre-specific roles based on prototypical works. To validate this framework, we conducted a multi-model study using six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate character-role correspondences across 40 narrative works. The validation employed both positive samples (160 valid correspondences) and negative samples (30 invalid correspondences) to evaluate whether models both recognize valid correspondences and reject invalid ones. LLMs achieved substantial performance (mean balanced accuracy of 82.5%) with strong inter-model agreement (Fleiss' $\\kappa$ = 0.600), demonstrating that the proposed correspondences capture systematic structural patterns. Performance varied by genre (ranging from 72.7% to 89.9%) and role (52.5% to 99.2%), with qualitative analysis revealing that variations reflect genuine narrative properties, including functional distribution in romance and deliberate archetypal subversion in satire. This character-based approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-supported methods for computational narratology and provides a foundation for future development of narrative generation methods and interactive storytelling applications.",

While platform technologies have advanced significantly-especially with the integration of large language models (LLMs)-we argue that improvements in platform service quality do not necessarily translate to genuine user benefit. Instead, platform-centric services prioritize provider objectives over user welfare, resulting in conflicts against user interests. This paper argues that the future of digital services should shift from a platform-centric to a user-centric agent. These user-centric agents prioritize privacy, align with user-defined goals, and grant users control over their preferences and actions. With advancements in LLMs and on-device intelligence, the realization of this vision is now feasible. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges in transitioning to user-centric intelligence, presents a practical device-cloud pipeline for its implementation, and discusses the necessary governance and ecosystem structures for its adoption.",

This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control.",

Existing approaches to refusal, spanning academic policy frameworks and commercially deployed systems, often rely on broad topic-based bans or offensive-focused taxonomies. As a result, they can yield inconsistent decisions, over-restrict legitimate defenders, and behave brittlely under obfuscation or request segmentation. We argue that effective refusal requires explicitly modeling the trade-off between offensive risk and defensive benefit, rather than relying solely on intent or offensive classification. In this paper, we introduce a content-based framework for designing and auditing cyber refusal policies that makes offense-defense tradeoffs explicit. The framework characterizes requests along five dimensions: Offensive Action Contribution, Offensive Risk, Technical Complexity, Defensive Benefit, and Expected Frequency for Legitimate Users, grounded in the technical substance of the request rather than stated intent. We demonstrate that this content-grounded approach resolves inconsistencies in current frontier model behavior and allows organizations to construct tunable, risk-aware refusal policies.",

        "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various vision tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs. While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\\% accuracy (+1.64 \\%) with 39.4\\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.",

        "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.",

        "abstract": "Large language models achieve strong performance on many complex reasoning tasks, yet their accuracy degrades sharply on benchmarks that require compositional reasoning, including ARC-AGI-2, GPQA, MATH, BBH, and HLE. Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE.",

        "abstract": "Visual analogy learning enables image manipulation through demonstration rather than textual description, allowing users to specify complex transformations difficult to articulate in words. Given a triplet $\\{\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{a}'$, $\\mathbf{b}\\}$, the goal is to generate $\\mathbf{b}'$ such that $\\mathbf{a} : \\mathbf{a}' :: \\mathbf{b} : \\mathbf{b}'$. Recent methods adapt text-to-image models to this task using a single Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, but they face a fundamental limitation: attempting to capture the diverse space of visual transformations within a fixed adaptation module constrains generalization capabilities. Inspired by recent work showing that LoRAs in constrained domains span meaningful, interpolatable semantic spaces, we propose LoRWeB, a novel approach that specializes the model for each analogy task at inference time through dynamic composition of learned transformation primitives, informally, choosing a point in a \"space of LoRAs\". We introduce two key components: (1) a learnable basis of LoRA modules, to span the space of different visual transformations, and (2) a lightweight encoder that dynamically selects and weighs these basis LoRAs based on the input analogy pair. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations. Our findings suggest that LoRA basis decompositions are a promising direction for flexible visual manipulation. Code and data are in https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/lorweb",

Estimating such effects requires researchers to run controlled experiments that systematically vary textual features. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise for generating text, producing and evaluating controlled variation requires more careful attention. In this paper, we present an end-to-end pipeline for the generation and causal estimation of latent textual interventions. Our work first performs hypothesis generation and steering via sparse autoencoders (SAEs), followed by robust causal estimation. Our pipeline addresses both computational and statistical challenges in text-as-treatment experiments. We demonstrate that naive estimation of causal effects suffers from significant bias as text inherently conflates treatment and covariate information. We describe the estimation bias induced in this setting and propose a solution based on covariate residualization. Our empirical results show that our pipeline effectively induces variation in target features and mitigates estimation error, providing a robust foundation for causal effect estimation in text-as-treatment settings.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid motion control has witnessed significant breakthroughs in recent years, with deep reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a primary catalyst for achieving complex, human-like behaviors. However, the high dimensionality and intricate dynamics of humanoid robots make manual motion design impractical, leading to a heavy reliance on expensive motion capture (MoCap) data. These datasets are not only costly to acquire but also frequently lack the necessary geometric context of the surrounding physical environment. Consequently, existing motion synthesis frameworks often suffer from a decoupling of motion and scene, resulting in physical inconsistencies such as contact slippage or mesh penetration during terrain-aware tasks. In this work, we present MeshMimic, an innovative framework that bridges 3D scene reconstruction and embodied intelligence to enable humanoid robots to learn coupled \"motion-terrain\" interactions directly from video. By leveraging state-of-the-art 3D vision models, our framework precisely segments and reconstructs both human trajectories and the underlying 3D geometry of terrains and objects. We introduce an optimization algorithm based on kinematic consistency to extract high-quality motion data from noisy visual reconstructions, alongside a contact-invariant retargeting method that transfers human-environment interaction features to the humanoid agent. Experimental results demonstrate that MeshMimic achieves robust, highly dynamic performance across diverse and challenging terrains. Our approach proves that a low-cost pipeline utilizing only consumer-grade monocular sensors can facilitate the training of complex physical interactions, offering a scalable path toward the autonomous evolution of humanoid robots in unstructured environments.",

We aim to generalize urban representation learning beyond city- and task-specific settings, towards a foundation-style model for urban analytics. To this end, we propose UrbanVerse, a model for cross-city urban representation learning and cross-task urban analytics. For cross-city generalization, UrbanVerse focuses on features local to the target regions and structural features of the nearby regions rather than the entire city. We model regions as nodes on a graph, which enables a random walk-based procedure to form \"sequences of regions\" that reflect both local and neighborhood structural features for urban region representation learning. For cross-task generalization, we propose a cross-task learning module named HCondDiffCT. This module integrates region-conditioned prior knowledge and task-conditioned semantics into the diffusion process to jointly model multiple downstream urban prediction tasks. HCondDiffCT is generic. It can also be integrated with existing urban representation learning models to enhance their downstream task effectiveness. Experiments on real-world datasets show that UrbanVerse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six tasks under cross-city settings, achieving up to 35.89% improvements in prediction accuracy.",

Using a novel benchmark comprising aligned training and out-of-domain test corpora, we evaluate the performance of foundation models across lemmatization and POS-tagging, and compare them with PIE, a task-specific RNN baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, even without fine-tuning, achieve competitive or superior performance in POS-tagging and lemmatization across most languages in few-shot settings. Significant challenges persist for languages characterized by complex morphology and non-Latin scripts, but we demonstrate that LLMs are a credible and relevant option for initiating linguistic annotation tasks in the absence of data, serving as an effective aid for annotation.",

Unlike test-based evaluation, a differential fuzzing-based equivalence checker needs no predefined test cases and can explore a much larger input space by executing and comparing thousands of automatically generated test inputs. In a large-scale evaluation of six LLMs (CodeLlama, Codestral, StarChat2, Qwen-2.5, Olmo-3, and GPT-4o) across three datasets and two refactoring types, we find that LLMs show a non-trivial tendency to alter program semantics, producing 19-35% functionally non-equivalent refactorings. Our experiments further demonstrate that about 21% of these non-equivalent refactorings remain undetected by the existing test suites of the three evaluated datasets. Collectively, the findings of this study imply that reliance on existing tests might overestimate functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings, which remain prone to semantic divergence.",

To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively.

We introduce Timestamped Audio Captioner (TAC), a model that produces temporally grounded audio descriptions at varying degrees of detail and resolution.

Across event detection and dense captioning, TAC outperforms all competing methods, with a low hallucination rate and accurate temporal grounding. We also introduce TAC-V, an audio-visual pipeline to generate semantically rich audio-visual descriptions.

Existing approaches, such as belief state estimation and inter-agent communication, often fall short. Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state.",

Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations.

Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry.",

A central challenge is to confine physical search to question-relevant subspaces while maintaining a compact, actionable memory of observations.

We introduce FAST-EQA, a question-conditioned framework that (i) identifies likely visual targets, (ii) scores global regions of interest to guide navigation, and (iii) employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning over visual memory to answer confidently. FAST-EQA maintains a bounded scene memory that stores a fixed-capacity set of region-target hypotheses and updates them online, enabling robust handling of both single and multi-target questions without unbounded growth. To expand coverage efficiently, a global exploration policy treats narrow openings and doors as high-value frontiers, complementing local target seeking with minimal computation. Together, these components focus the agent's attention, improve scene coverage, and improve answer reliability while running substantially faster than prior approaches. On HMEQA and EXPRESS-Bench, FAST-EQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, while performing competitively on OpenEQA and MT-HM3D.",

This mismatch can result in policies that perform poorly on low-probability states that are still within the safe set. A natural alternative is to frame the problem as a robust optimization over a set of initial conditions that specify the initial state, dynamics and safe set, but whether this problem has a solution depends on the feasibility of the specified set, which is unknown a priori. We propose Feasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE), a method that simultaneously identifies a subset of feasible initial conditions under which a safe policy exists, and learns a policy to solve the reachability problem over this set of initial conditions. Empirical results demonstrate that FGE learns policies with over 50% more coverage than the best existing method for challenging initial conditions across tasks in the MuJoCo simulator and the Kinetix simulator with pixel observations.",

However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.",

CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization and enforces the constraint by projecting edit updates onto the low-curvature subspace of the capability-loss landscape. At the crux of CrispEdit is expressing capability constraint via Bregman divergence, whose quadratic form yields the Gauss-Newton Hessian exactly and even when the base model is not trained to convergence. We make this second-order procedure efficient at the LLM scale using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) and a novel matrix-free projector that exploits Kronecker structure to avoid constructing massive projection matrices. Across standard model-editing benchmarks, CrispEdit achieves high edit success while keeping capability degradation below 1% on average across datasets, significantly improving over prior editors.",

In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL. Crucially, the combination of perception and skill composition enables autonomous, context-aware decision-making: using only onboard depth sensing and a discrete 2D velocity command, the robot selects and executes whether to step over, climb onto, vault or roll off obstacles of varying geometries and heights. We validate our framework with extensive real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating highly dynamic parkour skills such as climbing tall obstacles up to 1.25m (96% robot height), as well as long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time obstacle perturbations.",

In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos. During execution, Dex4D uses online point tracking for closed-loop perception and control. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robots show that our method enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks and yields consistent improvements over prior baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework.",

The SAH, however, lacks a precise definition, which has led to (i) different and seemingly orthogonal arguments supporting it, and (ii) important critiques to it. We propose a new metric called task complexity: the length of the shortest program that achieves a target performance on a task. In this framework, the SAH simply claims that pre-trained models drastically reduce the complexity of achieving high performance on many tasks. Our definition unifies prior arguments supporting the SAH, interpreting them as different strategies to find such short programs. Experimentally, we estimate the task complexity of mathematical reasoning, machine translation, and instruction following; we then show that these complexities can be remarkably low when conditioned on a pre-trained model. Further, we find that pre-training enables access to strong performances on our tasks, but it can require programs of gigabytes of length to access them. Post-training, on the other hand, collapses the complexity of reaching this same performance by several orders of magnitude. Overall, our results highlight that task adaptation often requires surprisingly little information -- often just a few kilobytes.",

Models must manage inventory with expiring goods, set prices, choose operating hours, and maximize profit over a 30-day period-tasks that any small business owner faces daily. All models demonstrate meaningful economic agency by achieving profitability, with performance scaling dramatically by sophistication-from basic models earning minimal profits to frontier models capturing 70% of theoretical optimal, a greater than 10x improvement. Yet our decomposition of business efficiency across six dimensions reveals a consistent pattern: models achieve local rather than global optimization, excelling in select areas while exhibiting surprising blind spots elsewhere.",

        "abstract": "Reliable sleep staging remains challenging for lightweight wearable devices such as single-channel electroencephalography (scEEG) or photoplethysmography (PPG). scEEG offers direct measurement of cortical activity and serves as the foundation for sleep staging, yet exhibits limited performance on light sleep stages. PPG provides a low-cost complement that captures autonomic signatures effective for detecting light sleep. However, prior PPG-based methods rely on full night recordings (8 - 10 hours) as input context, which is less practical to provide timely feedback for sleep intervention. In this work, we investigate scEEG-PPG fusion for 4-class sleep staging under short-window (30 s - 30 min) constraints. First, we evaluate the temporal context required for each modality, to better understand the relationship of sleep staging performance with respect to monitoring window. Second, we investigate three fusion strategies: score-level fusion, cross-attention fusion enabling feature-level interactions, and Mamba-enhanced fusion incorporating temporal context modeling. Third, we train and evaluate on the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) dataset and perform cross-dataset validation on the Cleveland Family Study (CFS) and the Apnea, Bariatric surgery, and CPAP (ABC) datasets. The Mamba-enhanced fusion achieves the best performance on MESA (Cohen's Kappa $\\kappa$ = 0.798, Acc = 86.9%), with particularly notable improvement in light sleep classification (F1-score: 85.63% vs. 77.76%, recall: 82.85% vs. 69.95% for scEEG alone), and generalizes well to CFS and ABC datasets with different populations. These findings suggest that scEEG-PPG fusion is a promising approach for lightweight wearable based sleep monitoring, offering a pathway toward more accessible sleep health assessment.

The air flow generated by the depressurization of the airlock, expanding in the lunar exosphere, is studied using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for two different venting configurations and the particle flux on the surface is computed as a function of the distance from the the module. Outgassing from the main body of the module -- assumed to be covered with a Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) blanketing -- and from the solar panels is then analyzed using a view-factor method, employing outgassing rates from the http://literature.Our results give preliminary indications of the distance at which contamination levels fall below the values characteristic of native species in the lunar atmosphere. Scientific measurements targeting 40Ar should be carried farther than 30--100 meters from the module, while the detection of lower-abundance species such as polar-crater water might require to travel up to and beyond 3 km from the module.",

While equilibrium models explain why strategic complementarities generate run risk, they offer limited guidance on how beliefs synchronize and propagate in real time. We develop a process-based agent-based model that makes the information and coordination layer explicit. Banks follow cash-first withdrawal processing with discounted fire-sale liquidation and an endogenous stress index. Depositors are heterogeneous in risk tolerance and in the weight placed on fundamentals versus social information, communicating on a heavy-tailed network calibrated to Twitter activity during March 2023. Depositor behavior is generated by a constrained large language model that maps each agent's information set into a discrete action and an optional post; we validate this policy against laboratory coordination evidence and theoretical benchmarks. Across 4,900 configurations and full LLM simulations, three findings emerge. Within-bank connectivity raises the likelihood and speed of withdrawal cascades holding fundamentals fixed. Cross-bank contagion exhibits a sharp phase transition near spillover rates of 0.10. Depositor overlap and network amplification interact nonlinearly, so channels weak in isolation become powerful in combination. In an SVB, First Republic, and regional bank scenario disciplined by crisis-era data, the model reproduces the observed ordering of failures and predicts substantially higher withdrawal rates among uninsured depositors. The results frame social correlation as a measurable amplifier of run risk alongside balance-sheet fundamentals.",

TokaMind supports multiple data modalities (time-series, 2D profiles, and videos) with different sampling rates, robust missing-signal handling, and efficient task adaptation via selectively loading and freezing four model components. To represent multi-modal signals, we use a training-free Discrete Cosine Transform embedding (DCT3D) and provide a clean interface for alternative embeddings (e.g., Variational Autoencoders - VAEs). We evaluate TokaMind on the recently introduced MAST benchmark TokaMark, comparing training and embedding strategies. Our results show that fine-tuned TokaMind outperforms the benchmark baseline on all but one task, and that, for several tasks, lightweight fine-tuning yields better performance than training the same architecture from scratch under a matched epoch budget. These findings highlight the benefits of multi-modal pretraining for tokamak plasma dynamics and provide a practical, extensible foundation for future fusion modeling tasks.

We take an indirect approach to this question: rather than analyzing the model architecture or training dynamics, we ask why a pretrained Bayes estimator, trained under a prespecified training distribution, can adapt to arbitrary test distributions. Focusing on Poisson EB problems, we identify the existence of universal priors such that training under these priors yields a near-optimal regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\frac{1}{n})$ uniformly over all test distributions. Our analysis leverages the classical phenomenon of posterior contraction in Bayesian statistics, showing that the pretrained transformer adapts to unknown test distributions precisely through posterior contraction. This perspective also explains the phenomenon of length generalization, in which the test sequence length exceeds the training length, as the model performs Bayesian inference using a generalized posterior.",

We mitigate these limitations by using supervised learning to approximate the minimum description length of residual unitaries and combining this estimate with stochastic beam search to identify near optimal gate sequences. Our method relies on a lightweight model with zero-shot generalization, substantially reducing training overhead compared to prior baselines.

With scaling laws only beginning to be studied in the field, we investigate neural scaling laws for boosted jet classification using the public JetClass dataset. We derive compute optimal scaling laws and identify an effective performance limit that can be consistently approached through increased compute. We study how data repetition, common in HEP where simulation is expensive, modifies the scaling yielding a quantifiable effective dataset size gain. We then study how the scaling coefficients and asymptotic performance limits vary with the choice of input features and particle multiplicity, demonstrating that increased compute reliably drives performance toward an asymptotic limit, and that more expressive, lower-level features can raise the performance limit and improve results at fixed dataset size.",

They are therefore an attractive choice as loss functions to train data-driven ensemble forecasts or post-processing methods when large training ensembles are either unavailable or computationally prohibitive. The adjusted continuous ranked probability score (aCRPS) is fair and unbiased with respect to ensemble size, provided forecast members are exchangeable and interpretable as conditionally independent draws from an underlying predictive distribution. However, distribution-aware post-processing methods that introduce structural dependency between members can violate this assumption, rendering aCRPS unfair. We demonstrate this effect using two approaches designed to minimize the expected aCRPS of a finite ensemble: (1) a linear member-by-member calibration, which couples members through a common dependency on the sample ensemble mean, and (2) a deep-learning method, which couples members via transformer self-attention across the ensemble dimension. In both cases, the results are sensitive to ensemble size and apparent gains in aCRPS can correspond to systematic unreliability characterized by over-dispersion. We introduce trajectory transformers as a proof-of-concept that ensemble-size independence can be achieved. This approach is an adaptation of the Post-processing Ensembles with Transformers (PoET) framework and applies self-attention over lead time while preserving the conditional independence required by aCRPS. When applied to weekly mean $T_{2m}$ forecasts from the ECMWF subseasonal forecasting system, this approach successfully reduces systematic model biases whilst also improving or maintaining forecast reliability regardless of the ensemble size used in training (3 vs 9 members) or real-time forecasts (9 vs 100 members).",
