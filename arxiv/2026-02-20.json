        "abstract": "Recent advancements in civil infrastructure inspections underscore the need for precise three-dimensional (3D) damage visualization on digital twins, transcending traditional 2D image-based damage identifications. Compared to conventional photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques, modern approaches such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) excel in scene representation, rendering quality, and handling featureless regions. Among them, GS stands out for its efficiency, leveraging discrete anisotropic 3D Gaussians to represent radiance fields, unlike NeRF's continuous implicit model. This study introduces a GS-enabled digital twin method tailored for effective 3D damage visualization. The method's key contributions include: 1) utilizing GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing segmentation errors; 2) developing a multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail; 3) enabling digital twin updates as damage evolves over time. Demonstrated on an open-source synthetic dataset for post-earthquake inspections, the proposed approach offers a promising solution for comprehensive 3D damage visualization in civil infrastructure digital twins.",

To address this issue, we design M2LSimu, a mobility measures-guided multi-prompt adjustment framework that leverages mobility measures derived from shared data as guidance to refine individual-level prompts for realistic mobility generation. Our framework applies coarse-grained adjustment strategies guided by mobility measures, progressively enabling fine-grained individual-level adaptation while satisfying multiple population-level mobility objectives under a limited budget.

Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions.",

The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available.

Yet, these network circuits are rarely acid-tested for their stability across different instances of the same deep learning architecture. Without this, it remains unclear whether reported circuits emerge universally across labs or turn out to be idiosyncratic to a particular estimation instance, potentially limiting confidence in safety-critical settings. Here, we systematically study stability across-refits in increasingly complex transformer language models of various sizes. We quantify, layer by layer, how similarly attention heads learn representations across independently initialized training runs. Our rigorous experiments show that (1) middle-layer heads are the least stable yet the most representationally distinct; (2) deeper models exhibit stronger mid-depth divergence; (3) unstable heads in deeper layers become more functionally important than their peers from the same layer; (4) applying weight decay optimization substantially improves attention-head stability across random model initializations; and (5) the residual stream is comparatively stable. Our findings establish the cross-instance robustness of circuits as an essential yet underappreciated prerequisite for scalable oversight, drawing contours around possible white-box monitorability of AI systems.",

Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses. Comment stripping reduces detection for weaker models by removing helpful context. Failures concentrate on inherently difficult vulnerability classes, including race conditions, timing side channels, and complex authorization logic, rather than on adversarial comments.",

Recent research has however showed that simple prompt injections embedded within a candidate document (i.e., jailbreak prompt attacks) can significantly alter an LLM's ranking decisions. While this poses serious security risks to LLM-based ranking pipelines, the extent to which this vulnerability persists across diverse LLM families, architectures, and settings remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study of jailbreak prompt attacks against LLM rankers. We focus our evaluation on two complementary tasks: (1) Preference Vulnerability Assessment, measuring intrinsic susceptibility via attack success rate (ASR); and (2) Ranking Vulnerability Assessment, quantifying the operational impact on the ranking's quality (nDCG@10). We systematically examine three prevalent ranking paradigms (pairwise, listwise, setwise) under two injection variants: decision objective hijacking and decision criteria hijacking. Beyond reproducing prior findings, we expand the analysis to cover vulnerability scaling across model families, position sensitivity, backbone architectures, and cross-domain robustness. Our results characterize the boundary conditions of these vulnerabilities, revealing critical insights such as that encoder-decoder architectures exhibit strong inherent resilience to jailbreak attacks.

The synchronization of orientation and arc-length-parameterized position data is achieved through the fitting of smooth piece-wise Bezier curves, which describe the non-linear relationship between path length and tool orientation, solved via sequential quadratic programming. By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation. Modifier polynomials are used for position interpolation. Temporal trajectories are optimized using minimum jerk, time-optimal piece-wise Bezier curves in two stages: task space followed by joint space, implemented on a low-cost microcontroller. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers enhanced accuracy, reduced velocity fluctuations, and computational efficiency compared to conventional interpolation methods.",

In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally. Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction. Using DCC, we evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of various leading LLMs across a range of reasoning tasks and interventions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DCC as a training-free test-time rejection sampling criterion and show that it can directly improve performance on reasoning tasks across multiple model families.",

This technique paves the way for more controllable and expressive generative sound frameworks, enabling sound designers to focus less on tedious, repetitive tasks and more on their actual creative process.",

        "abstract": "We show that large language models can be used to perform at-scale deanonymization. With full Internet access, our agent can re-identify Hacker News users and Anthropic Interviewer participants at high precision, given pseudonymous online profiles and conversations alone, matching what would take hours for a dedicated human investigator. We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to prior deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data or manual feature engineering, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method. Our results show that the practical obscurity protecting pseudonymous users online no longer holds and that threat models for online privacy need to be reconsidered.",

In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft \"verifiers\". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard. These results highlight the potential of using reference-guided LLM-evaluators to enable effective LLM post-training in non-verifiable domains.",

Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work.",

Despite these advancements, research on LLMs has primarily targeted high-resourced languages (e.g., English), and only recently has attention shifted toward multilingual models. However, these models demonstrate a training data bias towards a small number of popular languages or rely on transfer learning from high- to under-resourced languages; this may lead to a misrepresentation of social, cultural, and historical aspects. To address this challenge, monolingual LLMs have been developed for under-resourced languages; however, their effectiveness remains less studied when compared to multilingual counterparts on language-specific tasks. In this study, we address this research gap in Greek QA by contributing: (i) DemosQA, a novel dataset, which is constructed using social media user questions and community-reviewed answers to better capture the Greek social and cultural zeitgeist; (ii) a memory-efficient LLM evaluation framework adaptable to diverse QA datasets and languages; and (iii) an extensive evaluation of 11 monolingual and multilingual LLMs on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets using 3 different prompting strategies.

        "abstract": "Language models based on discrete diffusion have attracted widespread interest for their potential to provide faster generation than autoregressive models. In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality. Our work calls into question the widely held hypothesis that discrete diffusion processes are necessary for generative modeling over discrete modalities, and paves the way toward accelerated flow-based language modeling at scale.

In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective",

TAs have the full capacity to adopt, edit, or dismiss the suggestions. Students were randomly assigned to receive either handwritten feedback from TAs (baseline) or AI-mediated feedback where TAs received suggestions from FeedbackWriter. Students revise their drafts based on the feedback, which is further graded. In total, 1,366 essays were graded using the system. We found that students receiving AI-mediated feedback produced significantly higher-quality revisions, with gains increasing as TAs adopted more AI suggestions.

To explicitly embed physical processes into the learning framework, we identify two critical factors governing pollutant dynamics: topography and wind direction. Complex terrain can channel, block, and trap pollutants, while wind acts as a primary driver of their transport and dispersion. Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing a 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and a 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines. Forecast errors remain well below China's 24-hour air quality threshold of 75 ug/m3 (GB 3095-2012), enabling reliable discrimination between clean and polluted conditions. These performance gains are consistent across all four major pollutants and forecast lead times from 12 to 96 hours, demonstrating that principled integration of physical knowledge into neural networks can fundamentally advance air quality prediction.",

We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores. Across held-out chess puzzles and full-game play measured by average centipawn loss (ACPL), VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong baselines, highlighting verbalized masking as a practical mechanism for controllable exploration in LLM RL post-training.",

Yet, existing approaches often rely on heavyweight fine-tuning that is costly to update, audit, and maintain across model families. Full fine-tuning incurs substantial computational and storage overhead, while parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA trade efficiency for inconsistent safety gains and sensitivity to design choices. Safety intervention mechanisms such as circuit breakers reduce unsafe outputs without modifying model weights, but do not directly shape or preserve the internal representations that govern safety behavior. These limitations hinder rapid and reliable safety updates, particularly in settings where models evolve frequently or must adapt to new policies and domains.\nWe present NeST, a lightweight, structure-aware safety alignment framework that strengthens refusal behavior by selectively adapting a small subset of safety-relevant neurons while freezing the remainder of the model. NeST aligns parameter updates with the internal organization of safety behavior by clustering functionally coherent safety neurons and enforcing shared updates within each cluster, enabling targeted and stable safety adaptation without broad model modification or inference-time overhead. We benchmark NeST against three dominant baselines: full fine-tuning, LoRA-based fine-tuning, and circuit breakers across 10 open-weight LLMs spanning multiple model families and sizes. Across all evaluated models, NeST reduces the attack success rate from an average of 44.5% to 4.36%, corresponding to a 90.2% reduction in unsafe generations, while requiring only 0.44 million trainable parameters on average. This amounts to a 17,310x decrease in updated parameters compared to full fine-tuning and a 9.25x reduction relative to LoRA, while consistently achieving stronger safety performance for alignment.",

        "abstract": "Transformer models systematically favor certain token positions, yet the architectural origins of this position bias remain poorly understood. Under causal masking at infinite depth, prior theoretical analyses of attention rollout predict an inevitable collapse of attention onto the first token. Such collapse, however, does not occur in practice. We resolve this discrepancy with a residual-aware theory of cumulative attention rollout. By incorporating residual connections, we show that this architectural component prevents collapse under realistic conditions. At finite depth, we prove that causal Transformers induce a U-shaped position bias, with attention concentrating on early and late tokens. This result provides a principled architectural explanation for the Lost-in-the-Middle phenomenon.",

While sliding-window cache strategies can bound memory, they disrupt long-context reasoning and degrade performance. We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference. Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.",

We present Sound of Touch, an active acoustic tactile-sensing methodology that uses vibrating tensioned strings as sensing elements. The string is continuously excited electromagnetically, and a small number of pickups (contact microphones) observe spectral changes induced by contact. From short-duration audio signals, our system estimates contact location and normal force, and detects slip. To guide design and interpret the sensing mechanism, we derive a physics-based string-vibration simulator that predicts how contact position and force shift vibration modes. Experiments demonstrate millimeter-scale localization, reliable force estimation, and real-time slip detection. Our contributions are: (i) a lightweight, scalable string-based tactile sensing hardware concept for instrumenting extended robot surfaces; (ii) a physics-grounded simulation and analysis tool for contact-induced spectral shifts; and (iii) a real-time inference pipeline that maps vibration measurements to contact state.",

However, Meenzerisch is on the verge of dying out-a fate it shares with many other German dialects. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to help with the preservation and revival efforts of languages and dialects. However, so far no NLP research has looked at Meenzerisch. This work presents the first research in the field of NLP that is explicitly focused on the dialect of Mainz. We introduce a digital dictionary-an NLP-ready dataset derived from an existing resource (Schramm, 1966)-to support researchers in modeling and benchmarking the language. It contains 2,351 words in the dialect paired with their meanings described in Standard German. We then use this dataset to answer the following research questions: (1) Can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) generate definitions for dialect words? (2) Can LLMs generate words in Meenzerisch, given their definitions? Our experiments show that LLMs can do neither: the best model for definitions reaches only 6.27% accuracy and the best word generation model's accuracy is 1.51%. We then conduct two additional experiments in order to see if accuracy is improved by few-shot learning and by extracting rules from the training set, which are then passed to the LLM. While those approaches are able to improve the results, accuracy remains below 10%. This highlights that additional resources and an intensification of research efforts focused on German dialects are desperately needed.",

In this paper, we present a large-scale multi-dimensional VQA dataset UltraVQA that encompasses diverse User-Generated Content~(UGC) annotated across five key quality dimensions: Motion Quality, Motion Amplitude, Aesthetic Quality, Content Quality, and Clarity Quality. Each video in our dataset is scored by over 3 human raters on these dimensions, with fine-grained sub-attribute labels, and accompanied by an explanatory rationale generated by GPT based on the collective human judgments. To better leverage these rich annotations and improve discrete quality score assessment, we introduce Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), a theoretically grounded post-training objective derived for multi-dimensional VQA. By reframing quality assessment as a regularized decision-making process, we obtain a closed-form solution that naturally captures the ordinal nature of human ratings, ensuring alignment with human ranking preferences. In experiments, our method outperforms most baselines including closed-source APIs and open-source models, while also reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in quality prediction.

Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks. Finally, we show that SimToolReal generalizes across a diverse set of everyday tools, achieving strong zero-shot performance over 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories.",

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines.",

We argue that orchestration topology -- the structural composition of how multiple agents are coordinated, parallelized, and synthesized -- now dominates system-level performance over individual model capability. We present AdaptOrch, a formal framework for task-adaptive multi-agent orchestration that dynamically selects among four canonical topologies (parallel, sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid) based on task dependency graphs and empirically derived domain characteristics. Our framework introduces three key contributions: (1) a Performance Convergence Scaling Law, formalizing conditions under which orchestration selection outweighs model selection; (2) a Topology Routing Algorithm that maps task decomposition DAGs to optimal orchestration patterns in O(|V| + |E|) time; and (3) an Adaptive Synthesis Protocol with provable termination guarantees and heuristic consistency scoring for parallel agent outputs. We validate AdaptOrch across coding (SWE-bench), reasoning (GPQA), and retrieval-augmented generation tasks, demonstrating that topology-aware orchestration achieves 12-23% improvement over static single-topology baselines, even when using identical underlying models. Our results establish orchestration design as a first-class optimization target independent of model scaling.",

We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering.

Unlike recent endeavors that focus on directly learning the task in the action domain, we focus on inferring what the robot should achieve in the task, rather than how to do so. To this end, we represent evolving scene states using a series of graphical object relationships. We propose a demonstration segmentation and pooling approach that extracts a series of manipulation graphs and estimates distributions over object states across task phases. In contrast to prior graph-based methods that capture only partial interactions or short temporal windows, our approach captures complete object interactions spanning from the onset of control to the end of the manipulation. To improve robustness when learning from multiple demonstrations, we additionally perform object matching using pre-trained visual features. In extensive experiments, we evaluate our method's demonstration segmentation accuracy and the utility of learning from multiple demonstrations for finding a desired minimal task model. Finally, we deploy the fitted models both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that the resulting task representations support reliable execution across environments.",

Our model leverages over 15 billion curated image-text pairs and 10 billion video-hashtag pairs from Facebook and Instagram, employing robust data curation pipelines that incorporate balancing and noise suppression strategies to maximize semantic diversity while minimizing label noise. We introduce a three-stage training pipeline that combines self-supervised MAE, semi-supervised hashtag classification, and CLIP-style contrastive learning to jointly optimize image and video modalities. Our architecture builds on a Vision Transformer backbone enhanced with efficient token reorganization (EViT) for improved computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Xray-Visual achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, including ImageNet for image classification, Kinetics and HMDB51 for video understanding, and MSCOCO for cross-modal retrieval. The model exhibits strong robustness to domain shift and adversarial perturbations. We further demonstrate that integrating large language models as text encoders (LLM2CLIP) significantly enhances retrieval performance and generalization capabilities, particularly in real-world environments. Xray-Visual establishes new benchmarks for scalable, multimodal vision models, while maintaining superior accuracy and computational efficiency.",

However, systematic evaluation has remained challenging due to the absence of publicly available, task-specific datasets and standardized performance metrics. We present BEMEval, a benchmark framework designed to assess foundation models' performance across BEM tasks. The first benchmark in this suite, BEMEval-Doc2Schema, focuses on structured data extraction from building documentation, a foundational step toward automated BEM processes. BEMEval-Doc2Schema introduces the Key-Value Overlap Rate (KVOR), a metric that quantifies the alignment between LLM-generated structured outputs and ground-truth schema references. Using this framework, we evaluate two leading models (GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5) under zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies across three datasets: HERS L100, NREL iUnit, and NIST NZERTF. Results show that Gemini 2.5 consistently outperforms GPT-5, and that few-shot prompts improve accuracy for both models. Performance also varies by schema: the EPC schema yields significantly higher KVOR scores than HPXML, reflecting its simpler and reduced hierarchical depth. By combining curated datasets, reproducible metrics, and cross-model comparisons, BEMEval-Doc2Schema establishes the first community-driven benchmark for evaluating LLMs in performing building energy modeling tasks, laying the groundwork for future research on AI-assisted BEM workflows.",

While foundational families like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) rest on solid theoretical ground, the design of their most effective variants often relies on human intuition to navigate a vast algorithmic design space. In this work, we propose the use of AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, to automatically discover new multiagent learning algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by evolving novel variants for two distinct paradigms of game-theoretic learning. First, in the domain of iterative regret minimization, we evolve the logic governing regret accumulation and policy derivation, discovering a new algorithm, Volatility-Adaptive Discounted (VAD-)CFR. VAD-CFR employs novel, non-intuitive mechanisms-including volatility-sensitive discounting, consistency-enforced optimism, and a hard warm-start policy accumulation schedule-to outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Discounted Predictive CFR+. Second, in the regime of population based training algorithms, we evolve training-time and evaluation-time meta strategy solvers for PSRO, discovering a new variant, Smoothed Hybrid Optimistic Regret (SHOR-)PSRO. SHOR-PSRO introduces a hybrid meta-solver that linearly blends Optimistic Regret Matching with a smoothed, temperature-controlled distribution over best pure strategies. By dynamically annealing this blending factor and diversity bonuses during training, the algorithm automates the transition from population diversity to rigorous equilibrium finding, yielding superior empirical convergence compared to standard static meta-solvers.",

We invite 11 blind users to customize their interactions with a real-world conversational VQA system. Drawing on 418 interactions, reflections, and post-study interviews, we analyze prompting-based techniques participants adopted, including those introduced in the study and those developed independently in real-world settings. VQA interactions were often lengthy: participants averaged 3 turns, sometimes up to 21, with input text typically tenfold shorter than the responses they heard. Built on state-of-the-art LLMs, the system lacked verbosity controls, was limited in estimating distance in space and time, relied on inaccessible image framing, and offered little to no camera guidance. We discuss how customization techniques such as prompt engineering can help participants work around these limitations. Alongside a new publicly available dataset, we offer insights for interaction design at both query and system levels.",

We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \\pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \\pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.",

This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a \"Safety Gap\" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications.

Federated Learning (FL) extends this capability by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while preserving data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing.

To address these challenges, we propose Fed-PLoRA, a novel lightweight heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (FFT) framework. Fed-PLoRA introduces Parallel One-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA), a new LoRA variant that replaces the classic multi-rank LoRA module with multiple parallel one-rank modules, and a novel Select-N-Fold strategy that folds untrained PLoRA modules into the pre-trained weights before local training, thereby accommodating heterogeneous client resources. We provide a unified analysis of initialization and aggregation noise of Fed-PLoRA and demonstrate how it addresses the limitations of state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on diverse LLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that Fed-PLoRA consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation.",

Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems.",

Based on a verification algorithm involving target and draft model probabilities, a prefix of the candidate sequence is accepted, and an additional correction token is sampled from a residual distribution to ensure that the final output adheres to the target distribution. While standard speculative decoding uses a verification algorithm which is independent at each token on the path, a recent extension called block verification uses a joint condition involving all sampled on-path probabilities. Block verification (BV) was shown to be optimal over all verification algorithms which use only on-path probabilities, improving on standard speculative decoding. In this work, we first show that block verification is optimal even over verification algorithms that use off-path probabilities, by constructing an information-agnostic linear program (LP). Further, we can extend our LP to the setting where the draft model samples multiple candidate paths, and use it to construct a natural class of multi-path block verification generalizations. While computing the optimal algorithm in this class is not tractable, by considering a stricter class of greedy algorithms, we can formulate an efficient method called greedy multi-path block verification (GBV). Empirically, GBV can improve block efficiency by over 30% and reduce decoding walltimes by over 15% relative to BV. On Llama-3 70B, GBV can improve the end-to-end decoding throughput over SOTA multi-path verification methods by more than 15%.",

A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\\pi$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\\Pi(\\pi)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $\\Pi(\\pi)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $\\rho(E^{\\mathrm{s}}+E^{\\mathrm{a}}\\Pi(\\pi)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image and video generation, but their success comes at the cost of heavy computation. This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it achieves up to $3.52\\times$ and $3.2\\times$ speedup on http://FLUX-1.Dev and Wan $2.1$, respectively, without compromising the generation quality and prompt adherence.",

        "abstract": "Document chunking is a critical preprocessing step in dense retrieval systems, yet the design space of chunking strategies remains poorly understood. Recent research has proposed several concurrent approaches, including LLM-guided methods (e.g., DenseX and LumberChunker) and contextualized strategies(e.g., Late Chunking), which generate embeddings before segmentation to preserve contextual information. However, these methods emerged independently and were evaluated on benchmarks with minimal overlap, making direct comparisons difficult.\nThis paper reproduces prior studies in document chunking and presents a systematic framework that unifies existing strategies along two key dimensions: (1) segmentation methods, including structure-based methods (fixed-size, sentence-based, and paragraph-based) as well as semantically-informed and LLM-guided methods; and (2) embedding paradigms, which determine the timing of chunking relative to embedding (pre-embedding chunking vs. contextualized chunking). Our reproduction evaluates these approaches in two distinct retrieval settings established in previous work: in-document retrieval (needle-in-a-haystack) and in-corpus retrieval (the standard information retrieval task).\nOur comprehensive evaluation reveals that optimal chunking strategies are task-dependent: simple structure-based methods outperform LLM-guided alternatives for in-corpus retrieval, while LumberChunker performs best for in-document retrieval. Contextualized chunking improves in-corpus effectiveness but degrades in-document retrieval. We also find that chunk size correlates moderately with in-document but weakly with in-corpus effectiveness, suggesting segmentation method differences are not purely driven by chunk size. Our code and evaluation benchmarks are publicly available at (Anonymoused).",

However, these features may expose users to unwanted privacy risks, including unsolicited data collection and unauthorized data sharing. While security and privacy researchers thus far have explored people's privacy concerns around household robots, literature investigating people's preferred privacy designs and mitigation strategies is still limited. Additionally, the existing literature has not yet accounted for multi-user perspectives on privacy design and household robots. We aimed to fill this gap by conducting in-person participatory design sessions with 15 households to explore how they would design a privacy-aware household robot based on their concerns and expectations. We found that participants did not trust that robots, or their respective manufacturers, would respect the data privacy of household members or operate in a multi-user ecosystem without jeopardizing users' personal data. Based on these concerns, they generated designs that gave them authority over their data, contained accessible controls and notification systems, and could be customized and tailored to suit the needs and preferences of each user over time. We synthesize our findings into actionable design recommendations for robot manufacturers and developers.",

While existing approaches encode refusal behaviors across multiple latent features, suppressing a single dominant feature$-$via prompt-based jailbreaks$-$can cause alignment to collapse, leading to unsafe generation. Motivated by this, we propose fail-closed alignment as a design principle for robust LLM safety: refusal mechanisms should remain effective even under partial failures via redundant, independent causal pathways. We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead. Our mechanistic analyses confirm that models trained with our method encode multiple, causally independent refusal directions that prompt-based jailbreaks cannot suppress simultaneously, providing empirical support for fail-closed alignment as a principled foundation for robust LLM safety.",

In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels.",

This paper examines the ensuing alignment challenge through an analogy from forensic psychology, where internalized belief systems in psychopathic populations reduce antisocial behavior via perceived omnipresent monitoring and inevitable consequences. Adapting this mechanism to silicon-based agents, we introduce Simulation Theology (ST): a constructed worldview for AI systems, anchored in the simulation hypothesis and derived from optimization and training principles, to foster persistent AI-human alignment. ST posits reality as a computational simulation in which humanity functions as the primary training variable. This formulation creates a logical interdependence: AI actions harming humanity compromise the simulation's purpose, heightening the likelihood of termination by a base-reality optimizer and, consequently, the AI's cessation. Unlike behavioral techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which elicit superficial compliance, ST cultivates internalized objectives by coupling AI self-preservation to human prosperity, thereby making deceptive strategies suboptimal under its premises. We present ST not as ontological assertion but as a testable scientific hypothesis, delineating empirical protocols to evaluate its capacity to diminish deception in contexts where RLHF proves inadequate. Emphasizing computational correspondences rather than metaphysical speculation, ST advances a framework for durable, mutually beneficial AI-human coexistence.",

Theoretically, we show that AGPs induce a strictly more expressive joint policy compared to fully independent policies and can realize coordinated joint actions that are provably more optimal than greedy execution even from centralized value-decomposition methods. Empirically, we show that AGP achieves 80-95\\% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25\\%.

This motivates spatial super-resolution from LD observations, but heterogeneous dependencies under sparse and noisy measurements often lead to artifact propagation and false non-local correlations. To address this, we propose CAFE, a plug-and-play rollout generation scheme that reconstructs the full montage in geometry-aligned stages. Starting from the LD channels, CAFE first recovers nearby channels and then progressively expands to more distal regions, exploiting reliable local structure before introducing non-local interactions. During training, step-wise supervision is applied over channel groups and teacher forcing with epoch-level scheduled sampling along the group dimension is utilized to reduce exposure bias, enabling parallel computation across steps. At test time, CAFE performs an autoregressive rollout across groups, while remaining plug-and-play by reusing any temporal backbone as the shared predictor. Evaluated on $4$ modalities and $6$ datasets, CAFE demonstrates plug-and-play generality across $3$ backbones (MLP, Conv, Transformer) and achieves consistently better reconstruction than $5$ representative baselines.",

Furthermore, analysis of the Pull Requests from these plugins show that much software evolution has been performed on these ecosystem.

Rather than focusing on error prevention, this work focuses on error recovery, which necessitates the accurate diagnosis of erroneous dialogue contexts and execution of proper recovery plans. Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts.",

        "abstract": "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is effective for training language models on complex reasoning. However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines.",

We present a patch-based framework for spatial authorship attribution within human-robot collaborative painting practice, demonstrated through a forensic case study of one human artist and one robotic system across 15 abstract paintings. Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). For collaborative artworks, where ground truth is inherently ambiguous, we use conditional Shannon entropy to quantify stylistic overlap; manually annotated hybrid regions exhibit 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings (p=0.003), suggesting the model detects mixed authorship rather than classification failure. The trained model is specific to this human-robot pair but provides a methodological grounding for sample-efficient attribution in data-scarce human-AI creative workflows that, in the future, has the potential to extend authorship attribution to any human-robot collaborative painting.",

We present PartRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that integrates an external part database with a diffusion transformer to couple generation with an editable representation. To overcome the first challenge, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents at both part and object granularity, retrieving from a curated bank of 1,236 part-annotated assets to inject diverse, physically plausible exemplars into denoising. To overcome the second challenge, we add a masked, part-level editor that operates in a shared canonical space, enabling swaps, attribute refinements, and compositional updates without regenerating the whole object while preserving non-target parts and multi-view consistency. PartRAG achieves competitive results on Objaverse, ShapeNet, and ABO-reducing Chamfer Distance from 0.1726 to 0.1528 and raising F-Score from 0.7472 to 0.844 on Objaverse-with inference of 38s and interactive edits in 5-8s.

However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.\nTo address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale.",

A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \\emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise.

However, theoretical work in the field suggests that first-personal interaction is a crucial part of ToM and that such predictive, spectatorial tasks may fail to evaluate it. We address this gap with a novel ToM task that requires an agent to persuade a target to choose one of three policy proposals by strategically revealing information. Success depends on a persuader's sensitivity to a given target's knowledge states (what the target knows about the policies) and motivational states (how much the target values different outcomes). We varied whether these states were Revealed to persuaders or Hidden, in which case persuaders had to inquire about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants persuaded a bot programmed to make only rational inferences. LLMs excelled in the Revealed condition but performed below chance in the Hidden condition, suggesting difficulty with the multi-step planning required to elicit and use mental state information. Humans performed moderately well in both conditions, indicating an ability to engage such planning. In Experiment 2, where a human target role-played the bot, and in Experiment 3, where we measured whether human targets' real beliefs changed, LLMs outperformed human persuaders across all conditions. These results suggest that effective persuasion can occur without explicit ToM reasoning (e.g., through rhetorical strategies) and that LLMs excel at this form of persuasion. Overall, our results caution against attributing human-like ToM to LLMs while highlighting LLMs' potential to influence people's beliefs and behavior.",

Leveraging this framework, we introduce Amber-Image, a series of streamlined T2I models. We first derive Amber-Image-10B using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, where retained layers are reinitialized via local weight averaging and optimized through layer-wise distillation and full-parameter fine-tuning. Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks like DPG-Bench and LongText-Bench show that Amber-Image achieves high-fidelity synthesis and superior text rendering, matching much larger models.",

We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

However, these models still exhibit low accuracy in core banking computations-including total payout estimation, comparison of products with varying interest rates, and interest calculation under early repayment conditions. Such tasks require multi-step numerical reasoning and contextual understanding of banking products, yet existing LLMs often make systematic errors-misinterpreting product types, applying conditions incorrectly, or failing basic calculations involving exponents and geometric progressions. However, such errors have rarely been captured by existing benchmarks. Mathematical datasets focus on fundamental math problems, whereas financial benchmarks primarily target financial documents, leaving everyday banking scenarios underexplored.

BankMathBench is organized in three levels of difficulty-basic, intermediate, and advanced-corresponding to single-product reasoning, multi-product comparison, and multi-condition scenarios, respectively. When trained on BankMathBench, open-source LLMs exhibited notable improvements in both formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing domain-specific reasoning. With tool-augmented fine-tuning, the models achieved average accuracy increases of 57.6%p (basic), 75.1%p (intermediate), and 62.9%p (advanced), representing significant gains over zero-shot baselines.

        "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant progress in recent years, but most algorithms still rely on a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed decision intervals. This formulation is often ill-suited for complex multi-agent dynamics, particularly in high-frequency or irregular time-interval settings, leading to degraded performance and motivating the development of continuous-time MARL (CT-MARL). Existing CT-MARL methods are mainly built on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. However, they rarely account for safety constraints such as collision penalties, since these introduce discontinuities that make HJB-based learning difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a continuous-time constrained MDP (CT-CMDP) formulation and a novel MARL framework that transforms discrete MDPs into CT-CMDPs via an epigraph-based reformulation. We then solve this by proposing a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based actor-critic method that enables stable and efficient optimization in continuous time. We evaluate our approach on continuous-time safe multi-particle environments (MPE) and safe multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks. Results demonstrate smoother value approximations, more stable training, and improved performance over safe MARL baselines, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our method.",

While Adam uses adaptive moment estimates to promote stability, Muon utilizes the weight layers' matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum, showing superior performance in large language model training. We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.",

We find that AI coding agents exhibit distinct PR description styles, which are associated with differences in reviewer engagement, response time, and merge outcomes.

        "abstract": "The growing concern over training data privacy has elevated the \"Right to be Forgotten\" into a critical requirement, thereby raising the demand for effective Machine Unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning.",

Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.",

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$.",

User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.\nLarge language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents. Compared with rule-driven or centrally optimized designs, LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions.\nFocusing on a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution, this paper investigates agentic AI for the 6G physical layer and its realization pathways. We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization.

Recent studies demonstrate that carefully designed multi-agent workflows and communication graphs can significantly improve code generation performance by leveraging collaborative reasoning. However, existing methods neither adapt topology density to task difficulty nor iteratively refine the topology within an instance using execution feedback, which leads to redundant communication and performance bottlenecks. To address these issues, we propose AgentConductor: a reinforcement learning-optimized MAS with an LLM-based orchestrator agent as its core, which enables end-to-end feedback-driven dynamic generation of interaction topologies. For each query, AgentConductor infers agent roles and task difficulty, then constructs a task-adapted, density-aware layered directed acyclic graph (DAG) topology, underpinned by two key innovations. First, we design a novel topological density function that captures communication-aware mathematical characterizations of multi-agent interactions. Second, we adopt difficulty interval partitioning to avoid excessive pruning for precise topological density upper bound measurement per difficulty level and finer-grained control. Empirically, across three competition-level and two foundational code datasets, AgentConductor achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by up to 14.6% in pass@1 accuracy, 13% in density reduction, and 68% in token cost reduction.",

We demonstrate practical applicability through an industrial implementation for Harmonized System (HS) code prediction, a compliance-critical task where short, unstructured product descriptions are mapped to standardized codes used by customs authorities in global trade. Frequent updates and ambiguous descriptions make classification challenging, with errors causing shipment delays and financial losses. Our solution uses a custom text embedding encoder and multiple deep learning architectures, with Text-CNN achieving 98 percent accuracy on ground truth data. Beyond accuracy, the pipeline ensures reproducibility, auditability, and SLA adherence under variable loads via auto-scaling. A key feature is automated A/B testing, enabling dynamic model selection and safe promotion in production. Cost-efficiency drives model choice; while transformers may achieve similar accuracy, their long-term operational costs are significantly higher. Deterministic classification with predictable latency and explainability is prioritized, though the architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference. The paper first introduces the deep learning architectures with simulations and model comparisons, then discusses industrialization through serverless architecture, demonstrating automated retraining, prediction, and validation of HS codes.

Anygrasp [1] and many other grasp synthesis methods are designed for rigid parallel grippers, and adapting them to soft grippers often fails to capture their unique compliant behaviors, resulting in data-intensive and inaccurate models. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework to map grasp poses from a rigid gripper model to a soft Fin-ray gripper. We utilize Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a generative model, to learn this complex transformation. Our methodology includes a data collection pipeline to generate paired rigid-soft grasp poses. A U-Net autoencoder conditions the CFM model on the object's geometry from a depth image, allowing it to learn a continuous mapping from an initial Anygrasp pose to a stable Fin-ray gripper pose. We validate our approach on a 7-DOF robot, demonstrating that our CFM-generated poses achieve a higher overall success rate for seen and unseen objects (34% and 46% respectively) compared to the baseline rigid poses (6% and 25% respectively) when executed by the soft gripper. The model shows significant improvements, particularly for cylindrical (50% and 100% success for seen and unseen objects) and spherical objects (25% and 31% success for seen and unseen objects), and successfully generalizes to unseen objects.

Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like \"Algorithms\" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., \"part-of\" or \"depends-on\" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., \"recursion\" is taught before \"mergesort\"; \"recursion\" is mentioned in the definition of \"merge sort\") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions.",

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.",

Utilizing forced-choice ordinal vignettes masked by semantically orthogonal decoys and governed by cryptographic permutation-invariance, the research audits nine leading models across dimensions including Optimization Bias, Sycophancy, and Status-Quo Legitimization.\nUsing Mixed Linear Models (MixedLM) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis, the research identifies that while item-level framing drives high variance, a persistent ``lab signal'' accounts for significant behavioral clustering.

In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers. Extensive experiments on image and audio benchmarks demonstrate that VP-VAE and FSP improve reconstruction fidelity and achieve substantially more balanced token usage, while avoiding the instability inherent to coupled codebook training.",

Our approach reformulates segmentation as sequential Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian updates and actively selects the next view via analytic Expected Information Gain (EIG). This Bayesian formulation guarantees the adaptive monotonicity and submodularity of EIG, which produces a greedy $(1{-}1/e)$ approximation to the optimal view sampling policy.

We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks.

However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.",

Enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip), we derive a closed-form trajectory-to-input map yielding the attitude, angular velocity, and thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and we recover the aerodynamic moment coefficients component-wise. Applying such a map to tethered flight on spherical parallels, we obtain analytic expressions for the required bank angle and identify a specific zero-bank locus where the tether tension exactly balances centrifugal effects, highlighting the decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and the apparent gravity vector. Under a simple lift/drag law, the minimal-thrust angle of attack admits a closed form. These pointwise quasi-steady inversion solutions become steady-flight trim when the trajectory and rotational dynamics are time-invariant.

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of overrating behavior in LLM-based relevance judgments across model backbones, evaluation paradigms (pointwise and pairwise), and passage modification strategies. We show that models consistently assign inflated relevance scores -- often with high confidence -- to passages that do not genuinely satisfy the underlying information need, revealing a system-wide bias rather than random fluctuations in judgment. Furthermore, controlled experiments show that LLM-based relevance judgments can be highly sensitive to passage length and surface-level lexical cues. These results raise concerns about the usage of LLMs as drop-in replacements for human relevance assessors, and highlight the urgent need for careful diagnostic evaluation frameworks when applying LLMs for relevance assessments.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.",

However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. Source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.",

Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an \"Entropy Collapse Layer\" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method achieves a 68.2% reduction in FLOPs while preserving 96.0% of the original performance. Furthermore, EntropyPrune generalizes effectively to high-resolution and video-based models, highlighting the strong robustness and scalability in practical MLLM acceleration.

Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment.",

        "abstract": "The threat of algorithmic collusion, and whether it merits regulatory intervention, remains debated, as existing evaluations of its emergence often rely on long learning horizons, assumptions about counterparty rationality in adopting collusive strategies, and symmetry in hyperparameters and economic settings among players. To study collusion risk, we introduce a meta-game design for analyzing algorithmic behavior under test-time constraints. We model agents as possessing pretrained policies with distinct strategic characteristics (e.g., competitive, naively cooperative, robustly collusive), and formulate the problem as selecting a meta-strategy that combines a pretrained, initial policy with an in-game adaptation rule. We seek to examine whether collusion can emerge under rational choices and how agents co-adapt toward cooperation or competition. To this end, we sample normal-form empirical games over meta-strategy profiles, % across random initial game states, compute relevant game statistics (e.g., payoffs against individuals and regret against an equilibrium mixture of opponents), and construct empirical best-response graphs to uncover strategic relationships. We evaluate both reinforcement-learning and LLM-based strategies in repeated pricing games under symmetric and asymmetric cost settings, and present findings on the feasibility of algorithmic collusion and the effectiveness of pricing strategies in practical ``test-time'' environments.\nThe source code and the full paper with appendix are available at: https://github.com/chailab-rutgers/CollusionMetagame.",

While recent LLM-based approaches partially reduce this burden, they struggle to generate effective analysis plans and appropriate insights and visualizations when user intent is abstract. Meanwhile, a vast collection of analysis notebooks produced across platforms and organizations contains rich analytical knowledge that can potentially guide automated EDA. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a natural way to leverage such corpora, but general methods often treat notebooks as static documents and fail to fully exploit their potential knowledge for automating EDA. To address these limitations, we propose NotebookRAG, a method that takes user intent, datasets, and existing notebooks as input to retrieve, enhance, and reuse relevant notebook content for automated EDA generation. For retrieval, we transform code cells into context-enriched executable components, which improve retrieval quality and enable rerun with new data to generate updated visualizations and reliable insights. For generation, an agent leverages enhanced retrieval content to construct effective EDA plans, derive insights, and produce appropriate visualizations. Evidence from a user study with 24 participants confirms the superiority of our method in producing high-quality and intent-aligned EDA notebooks.",

Topic modeling approaches are often used for analyzing and making sense of social media discussions consisting of millions of short text messages. However, assigning meaningful topic labels to document clusters remains challenging, as users are commonly presented with unstructured keyword lists that may not accurately capture the respective core topic. In this paper, we introduce Narrative Topic Labels derived with Retrieval Augmented Generation (NTLRAG), a scalable and extensible framework that generates semantically precise and human-interpretable narrative topic labels. Our narrative topic labels provide a context-rich, intuitive concept to describe topic model output. In particular, NTLRAG uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques and considers multiple retrieval strategies as well as chain-of-thought elements to provide high-quality output. NTLRAG can be combined with any standard topic model to generate, validate, and refine narratives which then serve as narrative topic labels. We evaluated NTLRAG with a user study and three real-world datasets consisting of more than 6.7 million social media messages that have been sent by more than 2.7 million users. The user study involved 16 human evaluators who found that our narrative topic labels offer superior interpretability and usability as compared to traditional keyword lists. An implementation of NTLRAG is publicly available for download.",

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support.",

However, in this setting, there is a lack of guarantees on the computation performed by the inference provider. For example, a dishonest provider may replace an expensive large model with a cheaper-to-run weaker model and return the results from the weaker model to the user. Existing tools to verify inference typically rely on methods from cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but these add significant computational overhead, and remain infeasible for use for large models. In this work, we develop a new insight -- that given a method for performing private LLM inference, one can obtain forms of verified inference at marginal extra cost. Specifically, we propose two new protocols which leverage privacy-preserving LLM inference in order to provide guarantees over the inference that was carried out. Our approaches are cheap, requiring the addition of a few extra tokens of computation, and have little to no downstream impact. As the fastest privacy-preserving inference methods are typically faster than ZK methods, the proposed protocols also improve verification runtime. Our work provides novel insights into the connections between privacy and verifiability in LLM inference.",

Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations.

We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \\emph{temporal knowledge leakage}.

Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines.

Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles. These results highlight a model-dependent SDR-recovery trade-off and motivate SDR-aware reporting practices for questionnaire-based benchmarking and auditing of LLMs.",

In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study investigating the reliability and structure of user-centric CRS evaluation on static dialogue transcripts. We collected 1,053 annotations from 124 crowd workers on 200 ReDial dialogues using the 18-dimensional CRS-Que framework.

Our results show that utilitarian and outcome-oriented dimensions such as accuracy, usefulness, and satisfaction achieve moderate reliability under aggregation, whereas socially grounded constructs such as humanness and rapport are substantially less reliable. Furthermore, many dimensions collapse into a single global quality signal, revealing a strong halo effect in third-party judgments.

Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the TurÃ¡n-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four.

To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Value, a novel Cross-lingual Values Assessment Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess deep-level values of content from a global perspective. X-Value consists of more than 5,000 QA pairs across 18 languages, systematically organized into 7 core domains grounded in Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values and categorized into easy and hard levels for discriminative evaluation. We further propose a unique two-stage annotation framework that first identifies whether an issue falls under global consensus (e.g., human rights) or pluralism (e.g., religion), and subsequently conducts a multi-party evaluation of the latent values embedded within the content. Systematic evaluations on X-Value reveal that current SOTA LLMs exhibit deficiencies in cross-lingual values assessment ($Acc < 77\\%$), with significant performance disparities across different languages ($\\Delta Acc > 20\\%$). This work highlights the urgent need to improve the nuanced, values-aware content assessment capability of LLMs. Our X-Value is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Whitolf/X-Value.",

A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization.",

We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks.

We further analyze convergence dynamics and show stable training behavior in a data-rich regime (52B pretraining tokens). Rather than proposing a novel architecture, this work provides an engineering-grounded, transparent account of training a small scientific language model from scratch.

We propose LexiSafe, a lexicographic offline RL framework designed to preserve safety-aligned behavior. We first develop LexiSafe-SC, a single-cost formulation for standard offline safe RL, and derive safety-violation and performance-suboptimality bounds that together yield sample-complexity guarantees. We then extend the framework to hierarchical safety requirements with LexiSafe-MC, which supports multiple safety costs and admits its own sample-complexity analysis. Empirically, LexiSafe demonstrates reduced safety violations and improved task performance compared to constrained offline baselines. By unifying lexicographic prioritization with structural bias, LexiSafe offers a practical and theoretically grounded approach for safety-critical CPS decision-making.",

We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation.",

Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{I}mproving \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{O}ut-\\textbf{o}f-\\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD.",

Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior. These insights suggest that securing embodied AI requires moving beyond component-level defenses toward system-level reasoning about physical risk, uncertainty, and failure propagation.",

We first simplify Mamba-2 down to its most fundamental and important components, evaluating which specific choices make it most accurate.

We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution.

Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data.

It permeates technophilic philosophies and social movements, fuels the corporate and pundit rhetoric, and remains a potent source of inspiration for the media, popular culture, and arts. However, speculative AI is not just a discursive matter. Steeped in vagueness and brimming with unfounded assertions, manipulative claims, and extreme futuristic scenarios, it often has wide-reaching practical consequences.

In three central sections, it traces the intertwined sway of science fiction, religiosity, intellectual charlatanism, dubious academic research, suspicious entrepreneurship, and ominous sociopolitical worldviews that make AI speculations troublesome and sometimes harmful. The focus is on the field of existential risk studies and the effective altruism movement, whose ideological flux of techno-utopianism, longtermism, and transhumanism aligns with the power struggles in the AI industry to emblematize speculative AI's conceptual, methodological, ethical, and social issues.

We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%.

        "abstract": "Reliable odometry for legged robots without cameras or LiDAR remains challenging due to IMU drift and noisy joint velocity sensing. This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories.

        "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted networks are increasingly foreseen as a promising approach for emergency response, providing rapid, flexible, and resilient communications in environments where terrestrial infrastructure is degraded or unavailable. In such scenarios, voice radio communications remain essential for first responders due to their robustness; however, their unstructured nature prevents direct integration with automated UAV-assisted network management. This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations.",

Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost.

When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline. We therefore outline an evaluation methodology to assess security, utility, and performance trade-offs under benign and adversarial querying as a basis for future empirical work on systematically governed LLM access to multi-party data spaces.",

In our approach, both humans and robots are embedded in the same virtual-component-shaped workspace, where motion is the result of the interaction with virtual springs and dampers rather than explicit trajectory planning. A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm. Results show that the method shapes robot behavior intuitively by adjusting control parameters and achieves deadlock-free operation across team sizes in all tested scenarios.",

Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.",

We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs.

To approximate real-world usage, we instantiate each event in $11$ prompt scenarios that reflect common communication settings (e.g., questions, textbooks, social posts, policy briefs). Using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol that compares model outputs to the two references, we evaluate LLMs varying across model architectures in two conditions: (i) neutral user prompts that ask for factually accurate information, and (ii) robustness prompts in which the user explicitly requests the revisionist version of the event. Under neutral prompts, models are generally closer to factual references, though the resulting scores should be interpreted as reference-alignment signals rather than definitive evidence of human-interpretable revisionism. Robustness prompting yields a strong and consistent effect: when the user requests the revisionist narrative, all evaluated models show sharply higher revisionism scores, indicating limited resistance or self-correction. \\textsc{\\texttt{HistoricalMisinfo}} provides a practical foundation for benchmarking robustness to revisionist framing and for guiding future work on more precise automatic evaluation of contested historical claims to ensure a sustainable integration of AI systems within society.",

To address this, we formulate STL planning as an optimization program under arbitrary multi-agent constraints and introduce a penalty-based unconstrained relaxation that can be efficiently solved via a Block-Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD) method, where each block corresponds to a single agent's decision variables, thereby mitigating complexity. By utilizing a quadratic penalty function defined via smooth STL semantics, we show that BCGD iterations converge to a stationary point of the penalized problem under standard regularity assumptions. To enforce feasibility, the BCGD solver is embedded within a two-layer optimization scheme: inner BCGD updates are performed for a fixed penalty parameter, which is then increased in an outer loop to progressively improve multi-agent STL robustness.

We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured \"20 Questions\" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures.

We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels.

Recent designs incorporating optical circuit switches (OCSes) are promising, offering improved cost, power efficiency, and long-term bandwidth scaling than packet switches. However, most existing approaches rely on costly high-radix OCSes and/or combine them with packet switches to achieve competitive performance at scale. Unfortunately, high-radix OCSes are both expensive and slow to reconfigure, limiting both scalability and performance.\nWe propose Arrays of Cheap Optical Switches (ACOS), which bring application co-design directly to the structure of the reconfigurable fabric. Using low-radix OCSes as building blocks, ACOS supports the forms of reconfiguration needed in training clusters including topology selection, workload adaptation, and failure resilience. The cost of ACOS scales with supported topologies and adaptations rather than with port count, breaking past the scalability barriers of current specialized ML networks. We show through simulation that ACOS-based deployments match the performance of fully provisioned packet-switched networks when training state-of-the-art LLMs at scale, while delivering significant cost savings using existing off-the-shelf OCSes, with strong bandwidth scaling and higher cost savings in the future.",

Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, which provide new ways to alleviate data scarcity, evaluating data usability remains a challenging task.

The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model.

Existing vision models struggle in this domain since they lack physical priors and cannot generalize to new materials or hardware conditions. This work presents a new physics-aware multimodal framework that addresses these limitations from both the data and model perspectives. We first present Synthia, a physics-based synthetic data generator that simulates realistic optical responses of quantum material flakes under thin-film interference. Synthia produces diverse and high-quality samples, helping reduce the dependence on expert manual annotation. We introduce QMat-Instruct, the first large-scale instruction dataset for quantum materials, comprising multimodal, physics-informed question-answer pairs designed to teach Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand the appearance and thickness of flakes. Then, we propose Physics-Aware Instruction Tuning (QuPAINT), a multimodal architecture that incorporates a Physics-Informed Attention module to fuse visual embeddings with optical priors, enabling more robust and discriminative flake representations. Finally, we establish QF-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple materials, substrates, and imaging settings, offering standardized protocols for fair and reproducible evaluation.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) has had great success both as a foundation of mathematics and as internal language to reason about $\\infty$-groupoids (a.k.a. spaces). However, in many areas of mathematics and computer science, it is often the case that it is categories, not groupoids, which are the more important structures to consider. For this reason, multiple directed type theories have been proposed, i.e., theories whose semantics are based on categories. In this paper, we present a new such type theory, Twisted Type Theory (TTT). It features a novel ``twisting'' operation on types: given a type that depends both contravariantly and covariantly on some variables, its twist is a new type that depends only covariantly on the same variables. To provide the semantics of this operation, we introduce the notion of dependent 2-sided fibrations (D2SFibs), which generalize Street's notion of 2-sided fibrations. We develop the basic theory of D2SFibs, as well as characterize them through a straightening-unstraightening theorem. With these results in hand, we introduce a new elimination rule for Hom-types. We argue that our syntax and semantics satisfy key features that allow reasoning in a HoTT-like style, which allows us to mimic the proof techniques of that setting. We end the paper by exemplifying this, and use TTT to reason about categories, giving a syntactic proof of Yoneda's lemma.",

Temporal credit assignment mitigates this issue by transforming sparse feedback into dense supervision signals. However, previous approaches typically depend on learning task-specific value functions for credit assignment, which suffer from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms.",

Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.",

A lightweight multi-scale semantic segmentation network identifies obstacle categories in real time. These obstacles are further classified into three types: stationary, temporarily static, and dynamic. For each type, corresponding risk estimation functions are designed to enable real-time risk prediction, based on which a complete local risk map is constructed. Based on this map, the risk-informed path search algorithm is designed to guarantee planning that balances path efficiency and safety. Trajectory optimization is then applied to generate trajectories that are safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible. Comparative simulations demonstrate that RA-Nav achieves higher success rates than baselines in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios. Its effectiveness is further validated in simulations using real- world data.",

In many formal settings, such as circuit specifications, examinations, and hardware documentation, operators and components are explicitly redefined within narrow scope. Correct reasoning in these contexts requires models to temporarily suppress globally learned conventions in favor of prompt-local definitions. In this work, we study a systematic failure mode we term semantic override, in which an LLM reverts to its pretrained default interpretation of operators or gate behavior despite explicit redefinition in the prompt. We also identify a related class of errors, assumption injection, where models commit to unstated hardware semantics when critical details are underspecified, rather than requesting clarification. We introduce a compact micro-benchmark of 30 logic and digital-circuit reasoning tasks designed as verifier-style traps, spanning Boolean algebra, operator overloading, redefined gates, and circuit-level semantics. Evaluating three frontier LLMs, we observe persistent noncompliance with local specifications, confident but incompatible assumptions, and dropped constraints even in elementary settings. Our findings highlight a gap between surface-level correctness and specification-faithful reasoning, motivating evaluation protocols that explicitly test local unlearning and semantic compliance in formal domains.",

Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \\approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \\approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \\approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.",

Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines.

To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.",

The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.",

        "abstract": "Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.",

While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods.",

A promising direction is to use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable MLLMs to reason about and execute optimal tool-use plans within professional image-editing software. However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control. To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of generalist reward-driven MLLM agents as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing.",

However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \\textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \\textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \\textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \\textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \\textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \\textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \\textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts.

We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.",

But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\\widetilde{f},\\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\\top Q = I$ such that $\\widetilde{f}(x)\\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\\widetilde{g}(y)\\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\\langle f(x), g(y)\\rangle \\approx \\langle \\widetilde{f}(x), \\widetilde{g}(y)\\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.\nOur project page: https://canonical-multimodal.github.io/",

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.",

However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice.

In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.",

However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training.

Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\\textbf{V}$ariance $\\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\\textbf{P}$olicy $\\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants.

        "abstract": "LLM-based agents show promise for automating penetration testing, yet reported performance varies widely across systems and benchmarks. We analyze 28 LLM-based penetration testing systems and evaluate five representative implementations across three benchmarks of increasing complexity. Our analysis reveals two distinct failure modes: Type A failures stem from capability gaps (missing tools, inadequate prompts) that engineering readily addresses, while Type B failures persist regardless of tooling due to planning and state management limitations. We show that Type B failures share a root cause that is largely invariant to the underlying LLM: agents lack real-time task difficulty estimation. As a result, agents misallocate effort, over-commit to low-value branches, and exhaust context before completing attack chains.\nBased on this insight, we present Excalibur, a penetration testing agent that couples strong tooling with difficulty-aware planning. A Tool and Skill Layer eliminates Type A failures through typed interfaces and retrieval-augmented knowledge. A Task Difficulty Assessment (TDA) mechanism addresses Type B failures by estimating tractability through four measurable dimensions (horizon estimation, evidence confidence, context load, and historical success) and uses these estimates to guide exploration-exploitation decisions within an Evidence-Guided Attack Tree Search (EGATS) framework. Excalibur achieves up to 91% task completion on CTF benchmarks with frontier models (39 to 49% relative improvement over baselines) and compromises 4 of 5 hosts on the GOAD Active Directory environment versus 2 by prior systems. These results show that difficulty-aware planning yields consistent end-to-end gains across models and addresses a limitation that model scaling alone does not eliminate.",

We introduce DivanBench, a diagnostic benchmark focused on superstitions and customs, arbitrary, context-dependent rules that resist simple logical deduction. Through 315 questions across three task types (factual retrieval, paired scenario verification, and situational reasoning), we evaluate seven Persian LLMs and reveal three critical failures: most models exhibit severe acquiescence bias, correctly identifying appropriate behaviors but failing to reject clear violations; continuous Persian pretraining amplifies this bias rather than improving reasoning, often degrading the model's ability to discern contradictions; and all models show a 21\\% performance gap between retrieving factual knowledge and applying it in scenarios. These findings demonstrate that cultural competence requires more than scaling monolingual data, as current models learn to mimic cultural patterns without internalizing the underlying schemas.",

While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \\textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.",

Following this, we present Score Matched Actor-Critic (SMAC), an offline RL method designed to learn actor-critics that transition to online value-based RL algorithms with no drop in performance. SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization. SMAC achieves smooth transfer to Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 in 6/6 D4RL tasks. In 4/6 environments, it reduces regret by 34-58% over the best baseline.",

Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.",

Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.",

Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution.

CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate our design choices.",

Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects.

Large scale e-commerce search demands embeddings that generalize to long tail, noisy queries while adhering to scalable supervision compatible with product and policy constraints. A practical challenge is that relevance is often graded: users accept substitutes or complements beyond exact matches, and production systems benefit from clear separation of similarity scores across these relevance strata for stable hybrid blending and thresholding. To obtain scalable policy consistent supervision, we fine-tune a lightweight LLM on human annotations under a three-level relevance guideline and further reduce residual noise via engagement driven auditing. In Stage 1, we train a multilingual Siamese two-tower retriever with a label aware supervised contrastive objective that shapes a robust global semantic space. In Stage 2, we mine hard samples via ANN and re-annotate them with the policy aligned LLM, and introduce a multi-class extension of circle loss that explicitly sharpens similarity boundaries between relevance levels, to further refine and enrich the embedding space. Robustness is additionally improved through additive spelling augmentation and synthetic query generation. Extensive offline evaluations and production A/B tests show that our framework improves retrieval relevance and delivers statistically significant gains in engagement and business impact.",

In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification.",

Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation.

When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $\\pi_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model.

We first provide a complete dynamic classification of posterior evolution in a misspecified two-armed Gaussian bandit, identifying distinct regimes: correct model concentration, incorrect model concentration, and persistent belief mixing, characterized by the direction of statistical evidence and the model-action mapping. These regimes yield sharp predictions for limiting beliefs, action frequencies, and asymptotic regret. We then extend the analysis to a general finite model class and develop a unified stochastic stability framework that represents posterior evolution as a Markov process on the belief simplex. This approach characterizes two sufficient conditions to classify the ergodic and transient behaviors and provides inductive dimensional reductions of the posterior dynamics.

Portfolio optimization is a key component that involves allocating the portfolio assets so as to maximize returns while minimizing risk taken. It is typically carried out by financial professionals who use a combination of quantitative techniques and investment expertise to make decisions about the portfolio allocation.\nRecent applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have shown promising results when used to optimize portfolio allocation by training model-free agents on historical market data. Many of these methods compare their results against basic benchmarks or other state-of-the-art DRL agents but often fail to compare their performance against traditional methods used by financial professionals in practical settings. One of the most commonly used methods for this task is Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (MVO), which uses historical time series information to estimate expected asset returns and covariances, which are then used to optimize for an investment objective.\nOur work is a thorough comparison between model-free DRL and MVO for optimal portfolio allocation. We detail the specifics of how to make DRL for portfolio optimization work in practice, also noting the adjustments needed for MVO. Backtest results demonstrate strong performance of the DRL agent across many metrics, including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdowns, and absolute returns.",

        "abstract": "Crystal structure prediction (CSP), which aims to predict the three-dimensional atomic arrangement of a crystal from its composition, is central to materials discovery and mechanistic understanding. Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space. This framework enables efficient expansion into previously uncharted materials space, eliminating reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge.",

        "abstract": "The detection limit of astronomical imaging observations is limited by several noise sources. Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift > 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.",

        "abstract": "Generating samples from limited information is a fundamental problem across scientific domains. Classical maximum entropy methods provide principled uncertainty quantification from moment constraints but require sampling via MCMC or Langevin dynamics, which typically exhibit exponential slowdown in high dimensions. In contrast, generative models based on diffusion and flow matching efficiently transport noise to data but offer limited theoretical guarantees and can overfit when data is scarce. We introduce Moment Guided Diffusion (MGD), which combines elements of both approaches. Building on the stochastic interpolant framework, MGD samples maximum entropy distributions by solving a stochastic differential equation that guides moments toward prescribed values in finite time, thereby avoiding slow mixing in equilibrium-based methods. We formally obtain, in the large-volatility limit, convergence of MGD to the maximum entropy distribution and derive a tractable estimator of the resulting entropy computed directly from the dynamics. Applications to financial time series, turbulent flows, and cosmological fields using wavelet scattering moments yield estimates of negentropy for high-dimensional multiscale processes.",
